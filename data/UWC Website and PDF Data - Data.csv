“The unique context and ethos of the University of the Western Cape is reflected in the high level of support and benevolence provided by students, colleagues and members of the executive. This is what makes me ‘make the road by walking’ in everything I do.” - Prof. Monwabisi Ralarala, Dean of the Faculty of Arts.
“It's been an overwhelming experience ever since I joined the UWC Library team.I have been exposed to a lot of activities within my unit such as taking part in research seminars and workshops, libchat guidelines, creating online modules and web page development. The regular meetings that one attends for my unit has played a huge role in defining the library`s objectives and also understanding the key components of the unit and that of the university.
The support from my line manager as well as the unit team has made things more easy for me to adapt and see the bigger picture of the university.” - Mr Mlungisi Thusi, Research Support Librarian: Library Services.
“Joining UWC has been one of the best decisions in my professional career.

All staff training at UWC is guided by the principles and objectives encapsulated in the Institutional Operating Plan of the university. The HR department offers a range of staff development opportunities to ensure that the institution delivers on these objectives through empowering its academic and professional, administrative and support service staff. Some of our annual staff development training opportunities include: 
Annual On-boarding and Generic Training 
Annual Staff General Orientation
The Annual General Staff Orientation is a high-level on-boarding session, where all new staff members have the opportunity to be introduced to the University of the Western Cape’s various portfolios. This serves as the foundation for their journey at our institution, to gain insights into our practices, processes and culture at UWC. 
On-boarding/Monthly HR induction 
Staff who move into a new role or department or faculty are able to participate in on-boarding or monthly HR induction training. Induction is very important in providing new employees with the basic information and skills that they require to perform their new job successfully, ensures effective integration of employees into UWC, and helps create a positive and supportive working environment. It also helps define performance expectations, maintain motivation and identify the training and development needs of the new staff member. 
Annual Generic Training Calendar
While the topics for our Generic training calendar may be adjusted each year based
on the Institutional need, Staff and Organisational Development strive to ensure the
most relevant topics are considered, for all staff to benefit. Some of our most popular
course offerings include: 
Career Management Series
Effective Communication Skills
Emotional intelligence
Strategies for coping with stress and burnout
Critical thinking and creative problem solving
Cape Higher Education Consortium (CHEC)

https://www.uwc.ac.za/about/international-relations/strategic-partnerships,"Strategic Partnerships | UWC
UWC’s internationalisation strategy is underpinned by the principles of reciprocity, equity and mutual respect. We partner with institutions across a broad spectrum of research areas and academic programmes, with the goal of forging long-term sustainable relationships that aim to create new knowledge, build on existing scholarship and collaboratively address the global challenges facing humanity.
UWC’s network of international partners ensures an exciting exchange of students and eminent scholars from other countries to enrich the intellectual engagement between the Global North and the Global South. There is a strong and growing relationship with tertiary institutions in Africa, Europe and the Americas, as well as with China and the Asian-Pacific region. These affiliations lead to research partnerships, capacity-building and a mobility of knowledge talent to and from the university. UWC students, graduates and alumni have excelled in programmes abroad, and international students return to their home countries as global ambassadors, having thrived at UWC.
The Nordic scholarly partnerships with the universities of Bergen, Western Norway, Uppsala, Lund and Karlstad have borne fruit in the form of academic exchanges and innovative joint research, and have expanded into Biosciences, Business Innovation in the Economic and Management Sciences, Arts, Dentistry, Social Sciences and Health Sciences.
The South Africa-Sweden co-operation focuses on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is embodied by the South African Sweden Universities Forum (SASUF), which brings together researchers, funders, administrators and management from both countries to engage and drive a joint research agenda in several thematic areas.
UWC’s African-centred identity and nature has been enhanced by partnerships across Africa, with institutions such as Frantz Fanon University in Somaliland, Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique and the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. These institutions have joined existing African partnerships to focus on addressing the global challenges of our time.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/about/international-relations/tri-continental-partnership,"Tri-Continental Partnership | UWC
The Tri-Continental Partnership is a strategic relationship between UWC, the University of Missouri (UM) and Ghent University (UGent). The partnership between UWC and UM has existed for 34 years, while UGent and UWC have been engaging in collaboration for 18 years in the framework of the successful 10-year Programme on Dynamics of Building a Better Society (DBBS).
The three universities have extended their bilateral connections into a trilateral partnership, thus enhancing collaboration, from the early Memorandum of Agreement being signed in 2013 at UWC. Many joint research and scholarly engagements have been undertaken over the years. The key domains in this collaboration are Linguistics, Plant Sciences and Public Health, Astronomy, Neurosciences, Law, Humanities and Urban Planning and Psychology.
The University of Missouri System
For decades, the University of Missouri South African Education Programme (UMSAEP) has delivered on the goal of aiding South Africa’s disadvantaged, starting with divesting from its government’s support for the former apartheid policies. Since 1986, the University of Missouri System has partnered with UWC to advance mutual understanding between the institutions’ faculties and foster cooperative teaching, research and service projects.
When UWC and the UM System first began their academic co-operation, UWC was a university established exclusively for ‘coloured’ students under the racist apartheid regime.

iKamvalethu Fund: Supporting Students in Need
The University of the Western Cape (UWC) is committed to ensuring that financial hardship does not stand in the way of students achieving their academic goals. The iKamvalethu Fund has been established to provide financial relief to students facing economic challenges, helping them stay on track with their studies.
What is the iKamvalethu Fund?
The iKamvalethu Fund is a dedicated financial aid initiative focused on assisting students with historic debt and other critical financial needs. The Fund operates under clear guidelines to ensure fair and transparent allocation of resources, prioritising students who require urgent support to continue their studies.
Who Qualifies?
The Fund is designed to assist students identified by the University as being in financial distress. Categories of support are determined by the Fund Committee, with a focus on:
Students with outstanding historical debt preventing them from registering.
Students facing extreme financial hardship that affects their academic progress.
Special categories of need identified by the University.
At this stage, the Fund does not consider applications for daily expenses such as food and toiletries, as alternative support structures are in place for these needs.
How to Access the Fund
Students do not need to apply individually - the University’s Financial Aid and Student Leadership structures identify eligible students based on predetermined criteria. If you qualify, you will be notified directly.
For further details, contact Tracey Lippert at: tlippert@uwc.ac.za

Office for Students with Disabilities (OSwD)
The Office for Students with Disabilities (OSwD) facilitates universal access to higher education for students with disabilities at UWC. As the Office strives to ensure that all its registered students receive the same opportunities as the wider student population, the services are broadly targeted at three levels: 
supporting prospective students in their pre-university phase
facilitating a successful transition into UWC;
enhancing the employability profile of students and graduates.
Built on the principles of social justice, OSwD engages students as partners for advocacy and success. The Office provides reasonable disability-specific accommodations and assisting technology towards its students' academic success. This includes the conversion of academic material into various formats and overseeing departmental tests and exam procedures.
In 2019 the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSwD) acquired the first universal design disability venue at UWC. This project, funded by the DHET, was a key strategic initiative by the Student Development and Support Division (SDS) and the institution.
The new location ensures inclusive access through its universal design and an improved experience for students with disabilities, providing them with the basic right to a conducive educational space.
The new office space is an important landmark for students with disabilities on campus; through its detailed facilities, it communicates the university’s commitment towards inclusivity. Moreover, the universally designed venue promotes awareness and advocacy for persons.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/about/uwc-at-a-glance/history,"History | UWC
Protest action by students and black academic staff led to the appointment, in 1975, of the first black Rector. The new, freer climate under the leadership of Professor Richard E (Dick) van der Ross was amenable to intellectual debate and internationally respected scholarship.
In its mission statement of 1982, UWC Objectives, the university formally rejected the apartheid ideology on which it was established, adopting a declaration of nonracialism and ""a firm commitment to the development of the Third World communities in South Africa."" In 1983, through the University of the Western Cape Act of 1983, the university finally gained its autonomy on the same terms as the established ""white"" institutions.
The term of Professor Jakes Gerwel, who took office as Rector in 1987, saw an unambiguous alignment with the mass democratic movement and a new edge to the academic project. Under the banner of ""an intellectual home of the left"", space was created for curriculum renewal, innovative research and outreach projects. Important social and policy issues, which had been swept under the carpet by the government of the day, thus received attention.
The university also formalised its ""open"" admissions policy, providing access to a growing number of African students, and paving the way for rapid growth. Despite severe constraints, students from disadvantaged communities graduated in increasing numbers, equipped to make a professional contribution to the new South Africa. President Nelson Mandela lauded UWC for having transformed itself ""from an apartheid ethnic institution to a proud national asset.""
Read alumni recollections about UWC in the 1980s here
The 1990s were characterised by a sense of rich achievement. UWC played an important role in the emergence of the new democratic order. It provided opportunities for many people to prepare for a wide spectrum of higher-level careers and contributed significantly to policy research and formulation. UWC takes pride in the fact that so many of its senior academics and alumni found themselves in public office at all levels, a number in the national cabinet. The decade was also marked by a strong orientation to the future. There was a stronger focus on teaching and learning excellence. UWC's research productivity now places it in the upper group of universities and technikons in the country. A thorough review of structures and academic programmes at the institution was implemented in the 1990s. This led to decisions on the consolidation of efforts, to a more interdisciplinary thrust, and to the development of programmes which offer better access to the job market and show a more direct responsiveness to issues of national importance. In the words of Professor Cecil Abrahams, Vice-Chancellor from 1995, UWC is committed to being ""a Place of Quality, a Place to Grow.""
Towards the end of 2001, former UWC rector, Professor Brian O'Connell assumed the Vice-Chancellorship amidst a plethora of processes to restructure the higher education system in South Africa. In 2002, the Minister of National Education mapped the future higher education landscape. One of the outcomes of the restructuring process was that UWC would retain its status as an autonomous institution.
Under the visionary leadership of its current Rector, Professor Robert Balfour, the university is now, more than ever, challenged to demonstrate that it is capable of competing with the best and of playing a prominent role in the intellectual, social and economic life of the nation.
One of UWC's primary concerns for the future is to use its mandate to create and maintain a sense of hope for the nation whilst helping to build an equitable and dynamic society.
A second concern is with its role in the knowledge economy. It remains committed to creating, preserving and disseminating knowledge that is dynamic and relevant to the challenges of a modern world and a transforming society. A third concern, which is inseparable from the notions of hope and knowledge, is a concern with agency - the will and the ability to act, to be an agent of change.
A dynamic future beckons as UWC strives to remain a vibrant institution of high repute, in pursuit of excellence in teaching, learning and research. UWC believes that its strength will come from its ability to provide a nurturing space for its staff and students to grow in hope and to create and share knowledge to inform agency.
The University of the Western Cape (UWC) celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2020 amid a crippling pandemic.
However, COVID-19 served as a catalyst for expanded innovative thinking at the University. One milestone includes UWC scientists helping to decode the genome of COVID-19 to facilitate curbing its spread and to contribute towards finding a vaccine.
Researchers examined the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on South African society, from big business to spaza shops. UWC academics have worked to keep the public informed of the latest developments in the battle against Covid-19.
The University pioneered a virtual graduation ceremony during lockdown so that graduates could celebrate their hard work and achievements. Additionally, its #NoStudentWillBeLeftBehind appeal addressed the need of thousands of students who did not have the resources necessary for flexi-learning. Visit: http://60.uwc.ac.za/"

The University of the Western Cape's crest was developed in 1963 - three years after its founding - by a group of academic staff and students.
The university's name is used alongside the crest. This combination serves as the visual identifier for the university. The following elements individually represent a specific meaning: 
Proteas

The Protea is the national flower of South Africa and is found in great abundance and variety in the Western Cape – the home of the university. The three Proteas symbolise Teaching, Culture and Education. 
Laurel Leaves

The laurel leaves indicate competition and victory. The blue background represents brightness in our endeavour as an institution to obtain international insight, and the gold represents the earth in which our achievements are anchored. 
Greek Temple
The Greek Temple is the international symbol for academia and signifies our recognition that we are part of it. 
Motto
Respice Prospice means to look back, to look forward - to take what is worthy from the past and build the future."

Strategic Partnerships
UWC’s internationalisation strategy is underpinned by the principles of reciprocity, equity and mutual respect. We partner with institutions across a broad spectrum of research areas and academic programmes, with the goal of forging long-term sustainable relationships that aim to create new knowledge, build on existing scholarship and collaboratively address the global challenges facing humanity.
UWC’s network of international partners ensures an exciting exchange of students and eminent scholars from other countries to enrich the intellectual engagement between the Global North and the Global South. There is a strong and growing relationship with tertiary institutions in Africa, Europe and the Americas, as well as with China and the Asian-Pacific region. These affiliations lead to research partnerships, capacity-building and a mobility of knowledge talent to and from the university. UWC students, graduates and alumni have excelled in programmes abroad, and international students return to their home countries as global ambassadors, having thrived at UWC.
The Nordic scholarly partnerships with the universities of Bergen, Western Norway, Uppsala, Lund and Karlstad have borne fruit in the form of academic exchanges and innovative joint research, and have expanded into Biosciences, Business Innovation in the Economic and Management Sciences, Arts, Dentistry, Social Sciences and Health Sciences.
The South Africa-Sweden co-operation focuses on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is embodied by the South African Sweden Universities Forum (SASUF), which brings together researchers, funders, administrators and management from both countries to engage and drive a joint research agenda in several thematic areas.
UWC’s African-centred identity and nature has been enhanced by partnerships across Africa, with institutions such as Frantz Fanon University in Somaliland, Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique and the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. These institutions have joined existing African partnerships to focus on addressing the global challenges of our time.
Tri-Continental Partnership
The Tri-Continental Partnership is a strategic relationship between UWC, the University of Missouri (UM) and Ghent University (UGent). The partnership between UWC and UM has existed for 34 years, while UGent and UWC have been engaging in collaboration for 18 years in the framework of the successful 10-year Programme on Dynamics of Building a Better Society (DBBS).
The three universities have extended their bilateral connections into a trilateral partnership, thus enhancing collaboration, from the early Memorandum of Agreement being signed in 2013 at UWC. Many joint research and scholarly engagements have been undertaken over the years. The key domains in this collaboration are Linguistics, Plant Sciences and Public Health, Astronomy, Neurosciences, Law, Humanities and Urban Planning and Psychology. 
For decades, University of Missouri South African Education Programme (UMSAEP) has delivered on the goal of aiding South Africa’s disadvantaged, starting with divesting from its government’s support for the former apartheid policies. Since 1986, the University of Missouri System has partnered with UWC to advance mutual understanding between the institutions’ faculties and foster cooperative teaching, research and service projects.
When UWC and the UM System first began their academic co-operation, UWC was a university established exclusively for ‘coloured’ students under the racist apartheid regime.
From that humble beginning, UWC, in partnership with continental and international partnerships, has grown in strength. True to its DNA of being an intellectual centre of the anti-apartheid movement, it has leveraged this social justice foundation to lead in scholarly engagement, both on the continent and globally. UWC has done well in the World University Rankings, placing seventh in the Best University on the African continent. The Times Higher Education ranking for the impact of its research and global contribution has seen it enjoying a placement in the top 300 institutions worldwide.
SANORD is a network that brings together Nordic and Southern African institutions of higher education for research, dialogue and joint endeavours, based on shared fundamental values of democracy, social equity and academic engagement.
It promotes opportunities for research and mobility between the 50 partner institutions in the network. The network seeks to address new local and global challenges related to innovation and development. The SANORD Central Office is located at UWC and is a branch of the International Relations Office.
UWC enjoys a strategic institutional partnership with Ghent University, which ranks as a global top 100 university and one of the major universities in Belgium.
UWC offers a joint PhD with Ghent University in the Arts and Humanities, among other faculties. Ghent University’s 11 faculties offer more than 200 courses and conduct in-depth research within a wide range of scientific domains.
UWC enjoys a close and vibrant partnership with the 180-year-old VUB, which prides itself to have helped build a better society; as an innovative, free enquiring and critical thinking university.
VUB’s values mirror those of UWC - criticality, a democratic approach and the pursuit of social justice in service to humanity. The domain of Digital Sciences is a shared collaborative interest with VUB.

Main Campus
Location: Robert Sobukwe Road, Bellville 7535
The University of the Western Cape (UWC) is located in the Northern Suburbs of greater Cape Town – an area that is central to all facilities and amenities on the Cape Peninsula. UWC is home to more than 23 000 students who engage in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in our seven faculties. UWC houses thousands of students on campus and in private accommodation in the surrounding areas.
Our campus includes a nature reserve and the mountains of the Cape Peninsula and Stellenbosch afford beautiful landmarks to the east and west. The university is readily accessible by car, taxi, bus or train, and even has its own railway station, Unibell. Regional facilities, such as the Bellville central station and the Cape Town International Airport are a few minutes’ drive from the main campus.
The Western Cape region is a place of vibrant diversity, with a rich history as a cultural crossroads on the continent of Africa. UWC was placed beyond the edge of urban development in 1960. Out in the bush and sealed off from amenities, it was inhibited from being any kind of all political nuisance by an industrial barrier. The last barricade was the Transnet site in Robert Sobukwe Road. Ironically, UWC is now in the centre of the Cape Town metropolis.

Meet Professor Robert Balfour
One might assume that someone whose daily attire includes a wide-brimmed hat and a bow tie is cultivating eccentricity, indulging in a touch of self-regard, or making a sartorial statement. Among the notable wearers of such accessories are Sir Winston Churchill, Marlene Dietrich, Cam Newton, Sol Plaatje, David Kramer and Professor Robert John Balfour. Yet for Prof Balfour, UWC’s new Rector and Vice-Chancellor, the hat is less about fashion and more about practicality: “I think of hats as occupational health and safety gear, given that I burn in the sun so easily. If you see me with a hat, it’s not necessarily for fashion - though that is a happystance.”

The Council of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) is the highest governing structure of the university and is responsible for overall governance, in terms of the Higher Education Act and the Statute of the institution.
The Council is therefore responsible for oversight of UWC’s financial affairs, affairs relating to quality instruction and proper evaluation of students, its general reputation and standing within South Africa and the rest of the world, and for the maintenance of good order in the affairs of the institution. As the highest governing body of the institution, Council must ensure that the institution sustains the confidence of the public and of the State.
Its responsibilities include the appointment of the senior management, which is made up of the Rector and Vice-Chancellor, Vice-Rectors (or Deputy Vice-Chancellors), the Registrar, Executive Directors and academic Deans; approving all policies; and oversight of compliance within the higher education regulatory framework.

This right to privacy includes a right to protection against unlawful collection, retention, dissemination and use of personal information. UWC is committed to respecting, protecting, promoting and fulfilling the rights enshrined in the Bill of Rights.
In agreement with the constitutional values of democracy and openness, the need for economic and social progress within the framework of the information society requires the removal of unnecessary obstructions to the free flow of information, including personal information.
UWC further acknowledges that in order to regulate, in harmony with international standards, the processing of personal information must be done in a manner that gives effect to the right to privacy subject to justifiable limitations that are aimed at protecting other rights and important interests. 
The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) was signed into law on 19 November 2013, implementation became effective on 1 July 2021.
The purpose of the POPIA is to:
Give effect to the constitutional right to privacy by safeguarding personal information;
Balance the right to privacy against other rights, like the right of access to information;
Regulate the way in which personal information must be processed; and
Provide persons with the right and remedies if the POPIA is contravened.

Office of the Deputy Registrar: Academic Administration
The Office of the Deputy Registrar: Academic Administration forms part of the Registrar’s portfolio at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). To this end, we adhere to the mission of UWC and the strategic drivers as identified in the Institutional Operating Plan (IOP) as it pertains to Academic Administration. Effectiveness of its adherence will be influenced by people focus, internal organisational processes, innovation, and quality and risk management, as it will influence the quality management of student academic administration information and processes. The general focus of the Office of the Deputy Registrar is information and quality management as it relates to student academic administration information and processes. 
Academic Administration 
The Academic Administration Training & Development Unit (AATDU) is a division within the Office of the Deputy Registrar: Academic Administration. This Unit, established in September 2015, forms part of the Registrar's Portfolio at UWC. The general focus of this Unit is information and quality management as it relates to academic administration. 
Our vision is to be recognised for professional service excellence, regarded as knowledgeable, always supportive of issues and needs, and seen as an integral ""part of the solution"". 
Our goal is to support and serve the UWC community excellently by ensuring that our services are professional, student- and staff-centred, optimised by technology and complies with good governance. 
The aim of the Academic Administration Training & Development Unit is to advance academic administration and to support the Registrar's institutional strategic goals and imperatives through:

Among others, the Unit provides a comprehensive training programme that equips UWC administrative and support staff with the necessary skills to perform operational requirements.
We provide training for the following systems on campus:

Committee Management System (CMS)
Student Tracking System (STS)
The training programme provides for: 
New and existing staff members to learn how to perform the various SASI, CMS and STS functions related to their core responsibilities.

​Systems Access
Access to the University's systems are strictly managed by the Office and adhere to the principles of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). Access to our Student Administration System and other systems are limited to UWC employees only. Students and teaching assistants are not permitted to have access to any UWC information system. 
Student Administration 
We in the Department of Student Administration support the Registrar’s mission and vision by promoting and contributing to a university centred on professionalism and service excellence. At Student Administration, our goal is to become ‘invisible’, ensuring that processes happen without anyone even knowing that something is being done. The journey in realising an Administration that is ‘invisible’ is neither simple nor without its critics. However, it is a target that must constantly be aimed for. In order to achieve this level of effectiveness, we must be relevant to the changes of the 21st century and couple that with a high level of efficiency and reliability. 
To achieve these goals, it is necessary, at times, to reconsider why and how we do what we do. Student Administration, along with the Office of the Registrar, has begun such a process by re-engineering the structure of Student Administration. The new structure of Student Administration now has the International Students Services Office (ISSO), Faculty Liaison Office (FLO), Student Administration Helpdesk, and Examinations and Graduations Office (EGO). It is envisaged that this structure will allow us to function at an optimal level. Aligned with this new structure is the reviewing of our processes and refinement of these where necessary. The drive behind all our processes will be the use of the SASI system to its full capacity.
Student Administration includes the following functions: 
Examination and Graduation Office
Faculty Liaison Office
International Students Services Office
Student Administration Helpdesk
Learn more about these functions by visiting the Admission and Study section on this website, Click here
UWC Contact Centre 
The University of the Western Cape runs a fully functional Contact Centre with trained, professional agents who are equipped to deal with all student-related queries. The Centre offers students and related role players a client-orientated service through a single point of contact, providing improved efficiency and facilitating detailed measurement and planning.

The Secretariat
The Secretariat resides within the portfolio of the Registrar under the management of the Deputy Registrar: Secretariat and Policy Management. 
The Secretariat provides secretarial support to the Council, Senate and certain sub-committees.
In addition to providing secretarial support to the Council, Senate and certain sub-committees, the Secretariat is responsible for providing advice to committees on procedures that would enhance good governance and maintain the repository of the main institutional regulatory universe. In addition, the Secretariat, on behalf of the Registrar, is responsible for the safekeeping of official committee documents.
Our vision is to provide a professional, proactive and accountable service to all our stakeholders. 
Documents, Records and Archives Management Services (DRAMS)
The Department of Documents, Records and Archives Management Services (DRAMS) was established to ensure the establishment of a formal, efficient, legally compliant and legally defensible records and archives management programme at UWC. DRAMS exist to fulfil the University’s commitments to develop effective structures and conventions of governance, which are democratic, transparent and accountable.
As the official repository for the institutional archives of the University of the Western Cape, the University Archives compiles a record of the significant activities carried out in the fulfillment of UWC’s mission. The Archives preserves records as a resource for the University community and promotes the use of the collection by faculty, staff, students, alumni, and the general public.
Records Management supports the ongoing integrity of record-keeping at UWC, affecting both current and long-term documentation, and in this capacity supports and enhances the development of the University Archives.
All records, whether historically important or not, have legal retention requirements related to the function attending their creation. Some records are destroyed at the end of this required retention period, while others are preserved as historical records. The Central Records Office (CRO) stores records temporarily (at some point the records will either be destroyed or transferred into archival custody), whereas an Archives stores permanent, historical records. The DRAMS carry out both functions for UWC.

The Donor Relations Office is a support unit based in the Department for Institutional Advancement. It is focused on building strong, long lasting and mutually beneficial strategic partnerships, collaborations and networks with current and prospective donors with the aim to raise funds to support the university in delivering on its core goal areas. 
The main benefactors of the department’s fundraising efforts are UWC students. Funds raised through campaigns, initiatives, projects and events are utilised for student bursaries or scholarships, to provide nutrition support, the refurbishment and development of infrastructure such as student housing, student study support in the form of tutors, and leadership development, amongst others. Students are also able to access internship opportunities thanks to relationships that our office cultivates with the corporate sector.
HOW TO DONATE
The Donor Relations Office consists of a small team of dedicated staff who are committed to delivering a professional consulting service to faculties, academic departments, research chairs, centres and units in order to increase third stream income for the university. The team remains abreast of the latest trends in fundraising, stewardship and philanthropy within the higher education sector in order to, amongst others, guide faculties, departments and units on issues concerning donor engagement; provide fundraising advice and input on fundraising methods; advise on queries with regards to tax incentives; and provide input on donor proposals compiled by university staff.
Essentially, we provide support from initiation to implementation, acting as a link between the grant-maker and grant recipient and fostering strong relationships with both our internal and external stakeholders to do so. The office also oversees the monitoring and tracking of donations."

Mindful of its role in providing access to higher education, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) offers opportunities to students who are both academically deserving and financially lacking. These students are mostly drawn from disadvantaged schools that withstand adverse conditions and a lack of resources but possess the will to succeed.
Our department operates from a Central Office that co-ordinates student funding across the university. The Central Office works closely with the faculties and departments across the university to assist students that are financially disadvantaged. 
The Department of Student Funding administers NSFAS funding as well as bursaries and scholarships. As such, we are in a position to assist students with information on funding from NSFAS, bursary sponsors or scholarship opportunities where applicable.
Services to students are provided by the Financial Aid Advisors, based in the Financial Aid Office, behind the administration building (Prefabs) on the UWC main campus. 
Students who require funding information or assistance are encouraged to see their Financial Aid Advisors in their offices, who will gladly provide them with the necessary information.
Student Funding also provides donor liaison services to the various donors who provide funding and valuable support to financially needy and academically deserving students. The Financial Aid Advisors are the primary links with the donors and work closely with the donors assigned to each of them. The Central Office also works in close partnership with the private sector, public sector and non-governmental organisations to welcome and onboard any new sponsors who are keen to provide funding to students at UWC. Our donors are very important to our students, and we value donors who so generously support students of the University of the Western Cape. 
Vision and Mission 
The Financial Aid Office provides access, financial support and advisory services to all deserving students, especially learner intake from previously disadvantaged backgrounds.
The primary function of the Financial Aid Office is to award and manage bursaries and bursary loans according to agreed criteria. The mandate of the Financial Aid Office is aligned to the following institutional principles regarding financial support to students:
The Financial Aid Office strives to balance responsible stewardship of all financial aid funds with the creation of a student-centred culture. 
We are working to establish ourselves as a leader in financial aid services when measured against peer institutions, using technology to streamline financial aid processes and constantly looking forward to meeting challenges resulting from changes in federal, state, institutional and private funding rules and economic changes. 
We seek to model campus-wide communication and collaboration while respecting the needs, values, and diversity of our students, parents, and colleagues

The University of the Western Cape has pioneered as a leader in the policy development and implementation of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) within South Africa’s higher education landscape. RPL is an integral part of the Admissions Policy at UWC and finds expression in a range of services to support mature students (23 years and older) seeking alternative access into higher education degree programmes at UWC.
“Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is the formal acknowledgement of the knowledge, skills, competence, expertise and capabilities that people possess as a result of prior learning that may have occurred through formal, informal or non-formal.
means, through self-study, work or other life experiences.”
The domain of RPL is aligned to the main elements of the South African national policy discourse since 1994, with a specific focus of achieving transformation; accreditation; lifelong learning; and complying with the National qualifications framework (NQF) of South Africa. The main purpose of RPL is to facilitate access to, mobility across and progression within education, training, and career paths.

The UWC Alumni Relations Office, via its Legacy Programme, encourages alumni to consider nominating the university as a beneficiary in their last will and testament. 
Most notably among our alumni programmes is the annual Legend Reunions that celebrate people who significantly impacted the history of UWC and who continue to shape the future narrative of our institution
Other initiatives, such as the Access to Success programme, offer alumni the opportunity to provide financial support to academically gifted students in need of assistance.
The annual UWC Alumni Phonathon is the most personable way to stay in touch with your alma mater. During the Phonathon, which is scheduled over a few weeks, we call alumni across South Africa to reconnect and engage in conversation with them.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/about/alumni/legacy-fund,"Legacy Fund | UWC
Introduction
The UWC Legacy Fund aims to raise funds for the growth and advancement of the infrastructure at the University. This fund is intended to coincide with the institution's 100th Anniversary in 2060 or earlier if the target of R1 billion is reached.
UWC has grown in leaps and bounds, and while still offering qualifications in the traditional areas it was established to cater for, as a modern institution it needs to create facilities to offer qualifications for which jobs haven't been considered yet.
We want our Alumni to contribute to and drive this changing landscape.
The buildings and infrastructure on the various campuses of the University are showing signs of age and need to be bigger to accommodate the growing student population. Government funding of infrastructure projects has to be shared amongst all the priorities facing the fiscus and that limited pool has to support twenty-six universities. 
A recent survey on philanthropy in higher education reveals that only 6% of the total donor income is allocated to infrastructure development. Further analysis shows that funding from organisational donors is intended for bursaries and immediate use. Very little is allocated by donors for infrastructure and infrastructural growth into the future. UWC, therefore, needs to activate other means of raising funds for its infrastructure. 
The Legacy Fund is an endowment fund that seeks to collect small sums of money from many people over a long period. 
Aspiration
We aspire to raise R1 billion by 2060 when the institution turns 100, to develop infrastructure.
Our short-term target is to raise R200 million by 2033.
While this may seem like an insurmountable challenge, if everyone puts their minds and hearts to the call, we will achieve the target and more due to growth in the capital.
Our Alumni, our Ambassadors
Alumni contributions to higher education amount to just under 5% of all income derived from donations across all South African universities. The UWC Legacy Fund provides its alumni the opportunity to make a small yet valuable contribution to the development of teaching, learning and research infrastructure for generations to come.
American universities thrive on donations from their alumni. The Legacy Fund gives our Udubs alumni a common purpose to “pay it-forward”. Our alumni know the institution, have lived the values and have a vested interest in the growth of their alma mater.
Our focus is on our Alumni; however we welcome donations from all our stakeholders who share our aspiration to leave something valuable for our students, staff and communities that we serve.
Our Approach
To reach R200 million in ten years, we need to donate as little as R50 a month, every month, which means we need to involve at least 34 000 people to donate the bare minimum. 
We have more than 60 000 alumni across the globe, this number can be larger if our alumni engage their personal social networks to encourage others to share in this worthy cause. 
International alums can donate 50 dollars or 50 pounds, making their contribution all the more greater due to the exchange rate.
We have piloted the fund and found that alumni donate between R50 and R1000 per month. Some alums have chosen to donate large annual lump sums, and some of those donating monthly have elected to increase their donations every year. 
A simple analogy is that all that is required is to sacrifice one burger per month.
Payment and use of funds
Donors may fill out paper-based debit order forms or use our secure online payment facility to complete an electronic debit order instruction. You can also contact the Director of the Department of Institutional Advancement or the Manager of Alumni Relations to make arrangements to donate a lump sum directly into the University bank account.
The income will be invested in an endowment for use after ten year intervals if needed.
Your benefit
As a registered South African taxpayer, proof of your donations will be submitted to SARS using their latest e-filing system, and you will receive an annual tax certificate for your donations to the Legacy Fund.
We may not see the benefits of what we have done in 2060. However, at least we would have left something for others.
Lets act together 
Let’s pay it forward; give a little today to make a big difference tomorrow. We have a common goal to work towards to leave a legacy for the growth of the University of the Western Cape, South Africa and Africa at large.
Invite your friends, relatives, classmates and fellow alumni to grow the number of givers to a worthy cause.
Let’s grow our alma mater one brick at a time.

#AccesstoSuccess is a UWC fundraising initiative that aims to change this harsh reality faced by many students across South Africa every year. Donations from alumni, private businesses and staff are put to work to fund academically achieving students who want to study at our university.
Your donation allows academically gifted students to pursue tertiary education. We would therefore like to encourage you to consider donating and contributing to our students’ futures. For more information visit http://accesstosuccess.uwc.ac.za/"

A truly international university is one that creates a teaching and learning environment that prepares its students for their role as Global Citizens. This means students are not only academically well prepared, but also culturally attentive and up to date with global issues. As part of their studies at the University of the Western Cape, all registered students are encouraged to apply for financial assistance via the UWC Online Financial Assistance application. 
Students can also apply for alternative methods of funding and financial assistance such as bursaries and scholarships via the opportunities posted below.
The UWC financial assistance application process offers students the opportunity to qualify for bursaries and other opportunities based on academic performance and specific programmes that they have registered for, with many of our donors selecting students based on their academic average and particular programmes of study. 
Some of our donors and companies also host a number of events throughout the year for local and international students including the UWC Annual Careers Day, Internship programmes, donor presentations and inductions or bursary recipients.
To find out more about UWC Bursaries and Opportunities or to apply online visit Bursaries and Opportunities."

As of 1 August 2016, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) opened its student-centred application model.
First-time applications for financial aid, as well as funding renewal for those students who are already recipients of NSFAS funding, are handled centrally via NSFAS. While applicants may have applied to multiple institutions for admission to study, only one financial aid application linked directly to NSFAS will be required.
As of the 2018 academic year, an increase in the NSFAS financial eligibility criteria for first time entering students (FTENS) came into effect. 
Changing from a loan to a grant, while the gross income cut-off is set at R350 000 per family income per annum, the financial eligibility for current students remains unchanged.
All students and learners who need financial assistance are encouraged to apply to NSFAS through the NSFAS Online Application system. 
All potential first-year students applying to study in the subsequent year are required to apply directly to NSFAS via www.nsfas.org.za
Applications normally open from 1 September annually and close on 30 November the year before your admission and registration as a student.
Please apply early to ensure that you have the necessary documentation to submit the application.
Academic eligibility renewal criteria for all currently registered students (at any institution) already funded by NSFAS will be required to check eligibility for renewal, and will be informed of whether these students still meet the requirements for continued funding.
Students not currently funded by NSFAS, or who are on a government-funded bursary programme, may apply for funding if they require financial aid in the next academic year. For students in this category, applications normally open on 1 September annually and close on 30 November. If you think that your current funder may not renew your funding, you are encouraged to submit an NSFAS application before the closing date.
Late applications will not be considered. Late applications will not be accepted after the closing date and it is therefore important that your application is received on time. Applications open and close the year prior to your registration year.
How and where to apply
Visit the NSFAS website www.nsfas.org.za to register and complete your online application. 
The NSFAS contact details are outlined below should you require assistance or visit your closest tertiary institution's Financial Aid Office for further assistance.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS 
Entry requirements are the minimum academic standards that the University requires in order to consider you for entry into one of our degree programmes. However simply meeting the requirements does not guarantee you a place. Competition for most of our degrees is high and demand for places generally exceeds the number of places available. Final selection is made subject to the availability of places, academic results and other entry requirements where applicable.

What is an alternative admission?
Unless Senate determines otherwise, applicants who do not meet the formal requirements for admission to the university or a particular study programme, will not be admitted. 
Senate's Discretionary powers will be used when dealing with applications from the following categories of students:
Applicants who matriculated before 2008
The matriculation board will continue to function in its current capacity in 2009.
Until the status quo is changed, all regulations with regard to Senate Discretionary (SD) admission and exemption certificates that currently apply to applicants who completed matric before 2008, will continue to apply to this category of students in 2009 and thereafter.
Applicants who will complete the National Senior Certificate (NSC) in 2008 or thereafter
The certificates of candidates who will complete the NSC examinations in 2008 and thereafter will be endorsed to indicate the level of study for which they may be admitted to higher education institutions.
Candidates who complete matric in 2008 and thereafter, but who do not meet the admission criteria of the university, will only be admitted if in Senate’s Discretion if they have demonstrated competence during alternative assessments processes.
Admission Tests such as the National Benchmark Test (NBT) will be used to assess the competence of applicants who have endorsement for studying at a university, but not at the level for which they have applied. 
An RPL assessment process will be used to evaluate the competence of applicants who have not completed grade 12 or who have not obtained an endorsed National Senior Certificate. RPL Assessment Process. 
Applicants without an NSC or an endorsed NSC
Students who completed the NSC in 2008 or thereafter, but have not obtained endorsements, will be considered for alternative admission after the age of 23. This age is proposed on the assumption that an appropriate level of maturity and relevant experience or learning could be gained at 23 years of age. Such candidates will be required to complete a RPL portfolio development course and submit to a process where relevant learning and/or experience will be assessed.
Candidates who are 23 or older and do not have a matriculation certificate or NSC, but who might have obtained other qualifications or experience that may be deemed to be equivalent to admission criteria for particular study programmes, will also be required to complete a RPL portfolio development course or an RPL portfolio process as agreed and to submit to a process where such learning, qualification and/or experience will be assessed.

The South African education and training system is built with GET, FET and HET at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels respectively. Each successive NQF level is dependent on the previous NQF level of acquired knowledge, skills and competence. Each RPL applicant needs to identify or track where one is in the education pathway or NQF ladder. This is important in understanding what the options are for upgrading one’s education, skills and knowledge and guiding one in the process of attaining higher levels of qualifications.

Evaluation 
Evaluation of your international qualifications is essential to confirm the level of learning attained and the appropriate articulation with qualifications registered on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). The relevant statutory bodies seek to ascertain the equivalence or comparison of international qualifications with local qualifications to inform the minimum admission requirements to higher education. This is done in one of the following ways: 
Application for Exemption with Universities South Africa (USAf), formerly Higher Education South Africa (HESA). 
This process is for international applicants who wish to apply for exemption in order to be granted access to higher education in South Africa. The Exemption Application process and Methods of Application for undergraduate applications are outlined on the following USAf webpage: https://mb.usaf.ac.za/online-assessment-and-application/

Pre-Registration Clearance 
By now you have received your Final Acceptance Letter from University of the Western Cape (UWC) and have confirmed your acceptance of this offer. You may now begin pre-registration procedures before your academic registration.
By law, all international students intending to travel to the Republic of South Africa to study (whether remotely or face to face) must apply for a valid study (or any other relevant) permit and medical cover from a South African registered Medical Aid Scheme. International students who will participate in remote studies (online) outside of the Republic of South Africa are not required to produce a study permit and proof of medical cover before their registration. However, you must still complete the pre-registration clearance form and upload a passport bio page and affidavit/proof from a supervisor or faculty confirming that you will be studying remotely outside of the Republic of South Africa. 
Pre-registration Clearance Requirements
Upload proof of Exemption Status from USAf in the case of undergraduate registration or an Evaluation of Foreign Qualifications Certificate from SAQA in the case of postgraduate registration. USAf exemption clearance requests should be emailed to Tenille Williams: twilliams@uwc.ac.za or Akhona Ngesi (Akngesi@uwc.ac.za).

International students that will participate in remote studies (online) must only upload a passport bio page and an affidavit/proof from supervisor or faculty confirming that they will be studying remotely outside of the Republic of South Africa. 
For more information, please visit the Immigration page.
According to the Immigrations Act No. 13 of 2002 as amended and its regulations, international students with study permits are required to provide proof of medical cover for each academic year. The medical cover must be for the duration of the academic year, renewed annually for each registration. 
Please ensure that sufficient financial resources are available to meet this requirement. UWC is at no liberty to waive this requirement and will therefore not register a student without the requisite medical cover.

Welcome to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of the Western Cape!
The Faculty of Arts and Humanities at UWC is a vibrant intellectual space dedicated to exploring the systems, ideas, and values that shape human experience and society. Through rigorous scholarship, we examine the complexities of our world and seek to address the challenges of our time. While our work is internationally recognized, we remain deeply rooted in the realities of South Africa and Africa. This dual commitment ensures that our teaching and research speak directly to pressing local and global concerns.
Our Faculty offers a broad range of disciplines across the humanities and social sciences, providing opportunities to study language, literature, philosophy, religion, sociology, geography, and more. We are also home to four research centres that focus on critical issues such as cultural and linguistic diversity, social justice, African epistemologies, and the role of the arts in reimagining society. These centres produce cutting-edge research that addresses local challenges while contributing to global debates.
We are proud to have partnerships with a wide range of institutions across Africa and the world. These collaborations allow for faculty and student exchanges, joint research projects, and shared learning opportunities that enrich our academic community. The partnerships thus encourage a dynamic exchange of ideas, enhance our global engagement, and provide our students and staff with diverse perspectives and experiences that are essential to addressing complex societal issues. 
What You Can Do with a Degree in Arts and Humanities
An Arts and Humanities degree develops critical thinking, creativity, and analytical skills that are highly valued across various sectors. Our graduates excel in careers such as:
• Journalism, media, and communications
• Public policy and governance
• Education and academia
• Cultural and heritage sectors
• Business and entrepreneurship
• Non-profit and development work
Our alumni include award-winning authors, public sector leaders, educators, and social entrepreneurs. Their achievements demonstrate the adaptability and relevance of an Arts and Humanities education in addressing today’s complex and ever-evolving challenges. 
STEAM, Not STEM
Globally, there is a strong emphasis on STEM—Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics—as a way to address pressing challenges in technology and innovation. At UWC, we advocate for a STEAM approach that incorporates the Arts and Humanities into these disciplines.
While STEM advances technical knowledge, the Arts and Humanities provide the ethical, cultural, and social frameworks needed to guide these advancements. By asking critical questions about meaning, purpose, and impact, STEAM equips graduates to approach challenges holistically, ensuring that solutions are not only effective but also socially and culturally relevant. 
Undergraduate and Postgraduate Opportunities
Our undergraduate programs offer students the opportunity to engage deeply with diverse perspectives, fostering critical analysis, creative problem-solving, and intellectual curiosity. These programs provide a solid foundation for a variety of professional pathways.
For postgraduate students, the Faculty provides a stimulating research environment with opportunities to work alongside leading scholars. We offer a range of funding opportunities for postgraduate studies and postdoctoral research, enabling students to focus on advancing their academic and professional goals.
Through our international partnerships, postgraduate students also have opportunities to collaborate with global scholars and participate in exchange programs, broadening their academic horizons and enhancing their research. 
Join Us
The Faculty of Arts and Humanities at UWC offers an education that is rigorous, inspiring, and deeply engaged with the realities of our time. Our graduates are prepared not only to understand the complexities of the world but to shape it in meaningful ways. We invite you to join our community of scholars and thinkers—to engage with pressing local and global issues, collaborate with world-class researchers, and contribute to the production of knowledge that transforms lives and societies.

The Department of Geography, Environmental Studies and Tourism is a dynamic teaching and research department with a wide range of expertise in human and physical geography, GIScience, environmental management, and tourism. 
The UWC Department of Historical Studies is committed to changing the ways that history is taught, written about and represented. 
Like its parent institution, our Department is alert to its African and international context. It strives to be a place of quality and a place to grow from hope to agency through knowledge. 
South Africa is a highly multilingual society and recognises 11 official languages and hosts many more spoken varieties within its borders. In this respect, South Africa is typical of our world of complex translocal communities characterised by a linguistic dispensation where multilingualism is the norm. 
Philosophy has undergone a regeneration at UWC. For years, it offered only a few modules, but now it is back with a full programme of modules for a major and new philosophers on the staff. 
The Department of Religion and Theology at UWC offers modules in three subject areas, namely Theological Studies, Ethics, and Religious Studies. Collaborative research activities in the Department take place within six research frameworks, namely Religion; Ethics and Social Transformation; Religion and Gender; Religion and Development; Ecumenical Theology and Spirituality in Africa; Christian Ecotheology and Biblical Hermeneutics, and Rhetoric. 
The Department of Sociology at UWC has a rich intellectual tradition steeped in the highest standards of research and academic rigour. 
The Women’s & Gender Studies (WGS) Department is an inter- and transdisciplinary department that offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and engages in a wide range of collaborative research projects with local and international partners towards intersectional gender justice. 
The Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society (CASAS) was established in 1997 by its Founding Director, Prof. Kwesi Kwaa Prah, as a Pan- African Centre that would leverage the best available African expertise and scholarship to support a network of Africans addressing questions of interest to Africa. CASAS was donated in 2018 to the University of the Western Cape (UWC) to be located in the University’s Department of Linguistics, Arts and Humanities Faculty, by CASAS Founding Director, Professor Kwesi Kwaa Prah. 
Since its inception in 2006, the Centre for Humanities Research (CHR) at the University of the Western Cape has emerged as a crucial meeting point for researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences throughout Southern Africa. 
The central brief of the Centre for Multilingualism and Diversities Research is to embark on a project of intellectual reorientation, namely a significant rethinking of multilingualism and the development of a new discourse with which to approach interdisciplinary work in the humanities and the education sciences. 
The Desmond Tutu Centre for Religion and Social Justice is a research centre whose scholars challenge – contextually, theoretically, and methodologically – asymmetrical systems of power and commonly accepted assumptions about the social world and human experiences. 
The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has a new Research Chair in Forensic Linguistics and Multilingualism. This Chair is housed in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities, reporting to the Dean, Professor Monwabisi Ralarala.
This is the first of its kind in South Africa and on the African continent. Forensic Linguistics is a relatively new field of study in South Africa, though it is quite well established in places like the USA, UK and Australia. 
The UWC Chair in Media, Inclusion and Diversity aims to advance research, foster dialogue, and promote media inclusion and diversity initiatives. It drives scholarship and community engagement that advances an understanding of the complexities of media representation and promotes media literacy and critical thinking skills within media studies and related fields. Housed in the UWC Arts and Humanities Faculty, the Chair is jointly held by UWC Associate Professor in the Linguistics Department, Sisanda Nkoala and Professor Leo Van Audenhove, who is a professor of New Media and International Communication at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and an extraordinary professor at UWC.

The UWC Campus Health & Wellness Centre is operated by Dr DH (Manoj) Bagwandeen and Associates Inc. (the Company), a private Company that provides essential primary health / medical services in support of the UWC Campus community and especially the UWC student population.
The relationship between UWC and the Company is largely governed by a service level agreement which was reviewed and renewed since January 2018. 
Dr DH (Manoj) Bagwandeen qualified with a MBChB degree at the University of Natal – Medical School (now called the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine) in 1992. After successfully completing an internship at the internationally renowned Groote Schuur Hospital during 1993, he re-joined the University of Natal Medical School as a Registrar in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for a year during 1994. Dr Bagwandeen practiced as a General Practitioner in Durban (1995 to 1999) before joining the University of the Western Cape as the Head of Campus Health Services and later, as Director of Dr DH Bagwandeen and Associates Incorporated, a private company, which now provides medical services to the University.
Having always had a keen interest in the aesthetic aspects of medicine, Dr Bagwandeen decided to formally pursue this interest since 2010. He has since attended numerous specialised courses and conferences in medical aesthetics and has successfully completed the internationally recognised courses in aesthetic medicine offered by The American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine (AAAM). Dr Bagwandeen graduated Cum laude at the top of the class during the Board Certification examinations (August 2013) and is currently one of less than 300 doctors worldwide who is Board Certified by the AAAM.
In his pursuit to keep abreast of the latest and most effective treatment modalities in this exciting field, Dr Bagwandeen is constantly expanding his already vast experience and knowledge through ongoing studies and attending relevant courses throughout the world. Dr Bagwandeen has since also graduated Cum Laude and (once again) Top Student in the Advanced Diploma in Aesthetic Medicine by The Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) – November 2014. This is the only formally registered post-graduate course in Aesthetic Medicine offered in South Africa.
Dr Bagwandeen is qualified to perform the more advanced procedures using Botulinum Toxin A (BOTOX® or Dysport); fillers and medical skin peels and has a special interest in Laser and Energy based devices in Dermatology and Medical Aesthetics. He has trained in liposuction/liposculpture procedures using water-assisted liposuction (‘Body Jet’) and he has completed the ‘Master Course in Liposculpture Techniques’ (American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine – Dubai March 2014).
Dr Bagwandeen is also certified in the use of ‘Nutational Infrasonic Liposuction’ (tickle lipo) by ‘EUROMI’ (Belgium) using the ‘Euromi EVA’ machine. Dr Bagwandeen is further trained in the use of Laser-Assisted Liposuction procedures and fat grafting/fat transfer techniques. Hair restoration and surgical hair transplantation procedures is another field within Aesthetic Medicine that is in big demand. Dr Bagwandeen is trained in the use of the Medicamat Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) system of hair transplantation and he is also a certified trainer in this procedure.
Dr D H Bagwandeen is a registered member in good standing with:

The field of educational psychology is concerned with the study of learning in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching and of the school as a social institution. 
The Department of Educational Studies teaches courses in the social, political and historical foundations of education. We draw on a rich theoretical understanding of education, mindful of its implications for teaching practice in the South African context. 
The Language Education Department is a fast-growing department that is integral to the faculty’s teaching, research and community engagement endeavours. Regarding teaching, the department offers some 50 courses across four undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, aimed at producing language teachers who are competent in English, Afrikaans and/or isiXhosa, and who are at home in multilingual classes. 
IsiXhosa is South Africa’s second most popular mother tongue, spoken as a first language by 8.2 million South Africans. Despite the popularity of the language, there is limited expertise in the teaching of early literacy (reading and writing) in isiXhosa (and other African languages) in Teacher Education in South Africa. 
The Professor Richard van der Ross Resource Centre is located in the new state-of-the-art Faculty of Education building. The building represents the future of educator training in South Africa. The centre serves as a hub for a diverse range of events and is accessible to all.
The Science Learning Centre for Africa (SLCA), is an outreach programme of the School of Science and Mathematics Education (SSME). It is physically located in the Goldfields Resource Centre on the West Campus of the University of the Western Cape. It services the outreach functions of the SSME within the Faculty of Education of the University of the Western Cape. 
The Institute for Post-School Studies (IPSS) was established in the Faculty of Education in 2013. This was in line with the UWC Institutional Operating Plan and with the Faculty of Education decision to build a niche research area in the area of post-school studies. 
The School of Science and Mathematics Education (SSME) is committed to the development of a critical mass of quality professionals in the fields of science and mathematics education. Given its mission, it was necessary to ensure that all activities in the SSME are governed by a philosophy of quality and excellence."

The Department of Community Dentistry provides undergraduate as well as postgraduate programmes which enable students to make a diagnosis of a population’s oral health problems, establish the causes and effects of the problems and plan effective interventions through interdisciplinary co-operation and organised efforts of society.
The discipline is concerned with promoting the health of a population, and, therefore, focuses action at community level as opposed to an individual. 
The Department is dedicated to providing evidence-based dental and craniofacial health care through excellence in research, education,
and clinical practice.Our aim is to enhance our knowledge of craniofacial biology and elucidate the complexities of pathological conditions that impact dental and craniofacial health.
This is a diagnostic science department that provides a holistic evaluation of a disease/condition in terms of clinical, radiological and pathological investigations with the aim of providing an accurate diagnosis which informs the therapeutic management of the patient.
Through interdisciplinary collaboration, dental professionals are enabled to provide comprehensive care, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes and enhancing quality of life. 
The cluster, Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, and Anaesthesiology and Sedation consists of the two departments namely “Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery” as well as ”Anaesthesiology and Sedation”.
The cluster offers postgraduate programmes that vary from clinical postgraduate diplomas, a clinical specialist master’s programme, research masters and PhD studies. 
The Department of Oral Hygiene is primarily responsible for development and delivery of the Degree in Oral Health (BOH). 
The scope of expertise of the specialist in Oral Medicine and Periodontics includes the diagnosis and management of diseases, disorders and anomalies that affect the oral and periodontal tissues, as well as the oral and peri-oral manifestations of systemic diseases according to evidence based practices. 
The discipline of orthodontics focuses on the growth and development of the craniofacial complex and dental occlusion, as well as the treatment of abnormalities related to these structures. Although the word orthodontics is derived from the Greek ""orthos"" being ""straight"" and ""odontos"" being ""tooth"", the scope of orthodontics and orthodontic treatment is much wider than only the dentition.
Paediatric Dentistry encompasses all the different disciplines of dentistry for the child patient. The department caters to the needs of all children (including medically compromised and special needs children) under the age of 12 years.
The scope of Paediatric Dentistry involves the practice of oral and dental health care for infants, children and adolescents, through appropriate preventive, educational and treatment services, which includes treatment under general anaesthesia and sedation. 
The Department of Prosthodontics Dentistry core business is teaching removable prosthodontics, research, and clinical services. Teaching and learning removable prosthodontic courses in the undergraduate and postgraduate programs revolve around the rehabilitation of partially and completely edentulous patients. This involves the art and science of designing, planning, constructing and fitting removable artificial appliances or prosthesis in patients’ mouths to replace missing teeth.
The undergraduate curriculum in the BDS program commences from the second year, and spreads over four years. It consists of laboratory and clinical modules. At the end of fifth year, the student is able to successfully treat and manage edentulous patients that present with basic or advanced complications. 
The postgraduate programs share a joined platform between Prosthetic and Conservative Dentistry. Postgraduate programs include MChD - clinical Master’s program of 4 years, MSc - clinical Master of Science program of three years (open to international students) and MSc - research Master's program. The department also offer PDD diploma courses in aesthetic dentistry, removable prosthodontics and implantology. 
The WHO collaborating centres are institutions such as research institutes, parts of universities or academies, which the Director-General designates to carry out activities in support of the Organization’s programmes. Currently, there are over 800 WHO collaborating centres in 90 member states working with WHO on areas such as nursing, occupational health, communicable diseases, nutrition, mental health, chronic diseases and health technologies."

The School of Natural Medicine (SoNM) is dedicated to the education and training of professionals in various disciplines of complementary health sciences, as well as research within this field. Specifically, SoNM represents the professional disciplines of Acupuncture, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy, and Unani-Tibb, which are recognised within the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) under the Department of Health. These disciplines fall under the broader umbrella of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Traditional Medicine (TM), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cochrane Collaboration.
Natural Medicine and Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Context:
Natural medicine encompasses diverse healthcare systems that enhance the body's natural healing capacity, with or without synthetic pharmaceuticals. CAM is broadly defined as treatments that exist outside mainstream conventional medicine, encompassing a wide range of health systems, modalities, and practices based on different cultural and historical contexts. TM, as per the WHO, includes the knowledge, skills, and practices indigenous to different cultures, used for maintaining health, preventing illness, and treating physical and mental conditions. CAM and TM incorporate various treatment modalities, including nutritional medicine, lifestyle interventions, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, homoeopathy, massage therapy, energy medicine (e.g., Reiki), and mind-body techniques (e.g., meditation and yoga). 
Role of Natural Medicine in Health and Wellness Sector
Natural Medicine has a significant role in promoting health, preventing illness, and managing disease through holistic, patient-centred approaches, conventional medical knowledge and traditional knowledge systems. Patient management would be diverse between professions and based on the relevant Scope of Practice as outlined by AHPCSA. The contributions of natural medicine to healthcare are diverse and vary based on cultural, historical, and scientific perspectives. Natural medicine has numerous benefits, including preventative healthcare, integrative approaches to chronic disease and rehabilitation, expanding public access to healthcare, supporting integrative treatments with conventional medicine, promoting personalised patient-centred care, alongside contributions to regulation and professional development. 
Regulation and Professional Recognition in South Africa
Under the Allied Health Professions Act (Act 63 of 1984), the AHPCSA (regulated under the Department of Health) is responsible for regulating various CAM and TM professions in South Africa. These include Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Phytotherapy, Therapeutic Aromatherapy, Therapeutic Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Reflexology and Unani-Tibb. These professions represent a unique and protected niche within South Africa’s healthcare landscape. However, despite the legal recognition of these disciplines, there are limited training programs in South Africa that contribute to the education and professional registration of complementary health science practitioners.
The Role of the School of Natural Medicine
The University of the Western Cape is one of the few institutions in South Africa dedicated to the education, research, and professional development of practitioners in complementary health sciences. The SoNM plays a central role in integrating health science knowledge, traditional healing systems, holistic patient care, sustainability, and evidence-based practice, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for clinical practice, policy development, and research at regional, national, and global levels.
Future Programmes at the School of Natural Medicine
The SoNM is currently undergoing a curriculum re-structuring process, with future programs pending approval. Planned developments include the introduction of a Professional Bachelor’s degree, Master of Science degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas, and PhD programs. These new qualifications aim to enhance the academic and professional pathways for natural medicine practitioners while aligning with the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. Further information on these programs will be made available following the necessary institutional, statutory body, and government accreditations. 
The School of Nursing at the University of the Western Cape is located in the Belville Campus in the Community and Health Science Faculty. The school offers both undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education programmes. 
Established in 1993, the School of Public Health is unique in many respects both in South Africa and
in the continent."

History of Law Faculty
The history of the UWC Law Faculty starts with the establishment in 1960 of the University College of the Western Cape as a constituent college of the University of South Africa. A Department of Law was established in the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy in 1970, which presented the BA (law) and LLB degrees. A B.Com (law) degree was at the time presented by the Department of Commerce. In 1973, the Faculty of Commerce and Law was established. The Law Faculty became an independent faculty on 1 January 1979 when the Faculty of Commerce and Law was divided in two: the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences and the Faculty of Law. The Law Faculty was first located in what is now the Education building, then in a ‘prefab’ building which burned down, and later in what is now the ‘old arts’ building. In 1992, the faculty moved to the current law building. The faculty today has approximately 2,800 students (500+ of whom are postgraduate students) and 125 staff members, 50 of which are permanent academic appointments. 
Mission, vision and values
Vision 2035
By 2035, the Law Faculty wants to be widely recognised as one of the top law faculties on the African continent, as well as internationally, for the high quality of its academic programmes, the graduates it nurtures and develops, its research publications, and its social engagement, both in general, and in specialised fields.

We play a pivotal role in the education of law students, as we teach the core courses in the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) syllabus. These are: Criminal Law, the Law of Criminal Procedure, the Law of Civil Procedure, and the Law of Evidence. The latter three are the so-called “tools of the trade”, as they include equipping the prospective lawyer with the know-how required to litigate cases in court. 
The Department of Mercantile and Labour Law introduces students to the world of commercial and business law. The department’s focus is on developing students’ critical thinking skills and supplying them with practical, transferable capabilities to positively contribute to the legal profession or corporate field. 
The Department of Private Law offers a full complement of courses at undergraduate level and selected courses at postgraduate level. These courses are presented by experienced and highly-regarded law teachers who use contemporary and innovative teaching and assessment methodologies to enhance their students’ learning experiences. The department also possesses considerable supervision expertise in regard to LLM theses as well as LLD/PhD dissertations. 
The Department of Public Law and Jurisprudence prides itself on the extensive variety of courses it offers, both at undergraduate and postgraduate level, as well as its strong record of high quality research.

The Accelerated Excellence Programme (AEP) was introduced to UWC as a component of student retention as well as in alignment to UWC’s reward and recognition strategy.
The AEP was designed to support academically high performing second-year students in their studies and to arm them with 'essential' skills to flourish in the workplace.
The AEP is structured to include monthly lunch-time meetings and four residential modules that take place once a term. The modules include:
Presentation skills
Interview techniques and CV development
Entrepreneurship
Community development and leadership skills
All four of these modules are aligned to address and embed UWC’s charter of graduate attributes, which include demonstrating a scholarly attitude to knowledge and understanding within a rapidly changing environment, applying their knowledge to solve diverse problems and becoming agents for social good. Read more about the first cohort here.
The AEP is currently in the third year of existence. The major criterion is academic achievement in the first year of study. However, the equity of the group is considered as well. Therefore, the AEP’s participants are regarded as the high performing first year students across faculties which may not necessarily be the top achievers in the faculty. Each Dean reviews and approves the selection of the students of their respective faculties. The students approved by Deans are invited to participate in the AEP. 
AEP Graduation: Cohort 1 (2018)
AEP Graduation: Cohort 2 (2019)
AEP students also engage in group projects, such as Mandela Day activities and community engagement projects. An example is the collecting of plastic bottle tops for indigent communities to acquire wheelchairs.

UWC’s study on retention and success, entitled Operation Student Success (2016-2018) found high attrition and low retention rates amongst students, indicating that a significant number of students drop out of university and fewer complete in regulation time.
The UWC framework attempts to prioritise the retention and success of our undergraduate students and encourages everyone at UWC to work together to increase retention and student success. The framework provides a holistic approach to the retention and success challenge experienced at UWC, it is hoped that the framework will be used to followed by Student Retention Action Plans that will emanate from all sectors of the University, and that will identify action steps, responsible parties, timelines and intended outcomes.
Learn more about this framework by reading our comprehensive UWC Student Retention & Success Document and viewing the UWC Student & Retention Framework.
The First Year Experience at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) is a new institutional initiative that started in 2017. FYE aims to provide student-centred initiatives to enhance first year student transition and a quality student experience, thereby enabling students to stay and succeed at UWC. It is anticipated to foster a successful undergraduate student experience through strategic programming that focuses on positive academic transitions and the development of learning communities. Through partnerships with faculties, departments, units, staff, and student leaders; we envisage our FYE to create the space for students to define how they will engage, learn, and thrive at UWC.
First Year Transition Programme (FYTP)
The First Year Transition Programme (FYTP) is part of the FYE that focuses on enhancing first year students’ sense of belonging and connectedness to UWC. The aim is to ensure UWC supports their new incoming students with a smooth transition to the university. First Year Transition Officers (FYTOs) have been appointed in all seven faculties. These FYTOs are trained to ensure correct information, advice and support is offered to all first year students. The FYTOs report to Deputy Deans Teaching & Learning and work closely with the first year lecturers, mentors and students in their faculties. The programme is coordinated and funded from the DVC Academic’s office by Dr S Pather. Click the link to find out more about the First Year Experience Framework.
The First Year Student Guide developed for our new first-time entry students at UWC was a collaborative effort by staff members across departments and units at UWC.

In mid-2016, UWC STARS (Student Tutoring for Academic Retention & Success) Tutor Enhancement Programme (TEP) was created to enhance tutoring processes and practices at the University of Western Cape. The aim of TEP is to provide an effective and sustainable tutor programme that contributes to an increased student engagement, sense of belonging as well as academic retention and success. TEP provides an “engaging” tutoring programme that delivers quality tutoring in a collaborative and caring environment. The programme currently runs in all seven faculties and in two associated departments namely The Writing Centre and CIECT. 
Part of the mission of UWC’s TEP is to ensure that an inclusive environment is created to encourage learning opportunities and student success. Through this process, tutors and tutorials play an important role in creating learning communities that can support student success and strengthen UWC’s graduate attributes.

Phumelela@UWC has joined the Siyaphumelela (“We Succeed”) initiative, which is funded by the Kresge Foundation (USA). The Siyaphumelela initiative seeks to broaden evidence-based postsecondary student success strategies across South Africa. At UWC, the Phumelela@UWC project focus is on improving student retention and success. Data analytics will be used to inform practice and monitor student progression and success. UWC’s student retention and success framework will be used to guide a holistic approach to enhance the university’s undergraduate programmes. 
The following three areas will be our focus over the next three years: 
Area 1: Strengthening the university’s business intelligence capacity
Project 1: Use the grant to appoint an experienced data analyst, assist with data analytics, research and compiling reports. Initially appointed on a three-year contract basis, to augment the limited current capacity. Further action from BI unit: 
regular training workshops for faculty staff in support of the implementation of new/revised data tools.
at least twice a year, the Unit will convene colloquia in order to share findings and experiences
Area 2: Using Learning Analytics to Enhance Student Support
Project 2: Student support interventions to support student retention and success in a holistic approach, the following actions will be enhanced: 
Data Analytics to inform practice – SASSE and LASSE - 2021
Tutorial management system updated – track student attendance, progress, effectiveness and student engagement with learning processes.
First Year Transition Programme – first year mentors and first year online module to enhance student connectivity to the institution and support successful transition.
Second Year Transition: Make Your Mark (MYM) – offered by CSSS, to identify at-risk students and track and support students.
Mental Health and Wellbeing Promotion: CSSS online tool that is interactive, will direct students information needed, resources available on campus and support services.
Academic Advising (AA): decentralised model to strengthen AA in faculties. Presently AA done by faculty office with no structured support for students for academic advising; this is something which needs to be developed. 
Area 3: Curriculum and other support interventions
UWC policy document (presently in draft) titled: Principles for Curriculum Transformation and Renewal @UWC, will inform the unfolding of the curriculum and support interventions in faculties. With the use of data analytics, three faculties: Arts, Economic and Management Sciences, and Natural Sciences (identified high priority faculties) with the most ‘at risk’ modules and a pass rates below 55% will be used to pilot interventions.
Project 3: Interventions for high priority (at-risk) modules identified in the faculties (data analytics used to identify these modules) lecturers to highlight obstacles/challenges. 
Interventions need to be identified – process followed for support (grants available) to develop and pilot in innovative teaching and learning resources, such as videos, assessment tools, and online materials (including the use of augmented/virtual reality technologies, which are now available at UWC).

Curriculum Transformation and Renewal was identified as a priority learning and teaching goal for 2020. In October and November 2020, Prof Jo-Celene de Jongh coordinated a series of workshops led by SynNovation to a group of CHS lecturers in a series of creative thinking workshops online in order to tackle challenges faced in curriculum transformation. Lecturers were equipped with several creative thinking principles and tools that can be used, in collaborative small groups (with multiple and diverse stakeholders), to practically solve problems and generate novel solutions. Lecturers found these three workshops incredibly stimulating and beneficial to their curriculum design challenges (and beyond!)
TheZone@UWC gives students an entrepreneurial head start. A university degree is no longer a guarantee that one will find a job. In fact, according to StatsSA (2019), a third of graduates younger than 24 were unable to find work at the start of last year. 
In response to the growing need for graduates who are able to start their own businesses. TheZone@UWC was officially launched in September last year. Graduate employability is a key focus for the University of the Western Cape (UWC), and the university therefore endorsed the Zone Learning Programme in September last year to encourage entrepreneurship at a tertiary level.
How it works
With HDI funding, TheZone has been piloted in the Faculties of Law and Economic and Management Sciences. Professor Vivienne Lawack, UWC’s Deputy VC: Academic, said that with additional grant and donor funding, it could be extended to all seven faculties at UWC.
“The experiential incubation space will help promote certain graduate attributes and encourage community engagement, which is really at the heart of UWC. It will also enable students to become more employable.”
TheZone learning programme is unique in that it offers training using the Management Fundamentals of Entrepreneurship, a UWC-accredited module. Furthermore, students will have access to an internationally-acclaimed business simulator, SimVenture, that allows them to practically engage with the basics of starting their own business, from the start-up phase through to the drafting of marketing and operational plans.
“This kind of training would usually be offered as part of an MBA or post-graduate programme,” said Dr Marlin Hoffman, Entrepreneurship lecturer at UWC. However, it will be offered at no additional cost to undergraduates as part of TheZone’s entrepreneurial offering.
An Entrepreneurial Law Clinic (ELC) has been established and linked to the curriculum within the Law Clinic, to enable students to identify the kind of businesses enterprises that may be appropriate and the legal advice that may be required. Another aspect of TheZone is the Small Business Clinic which, in partnership with the Economic and Management Sciences Faculty, will provide business support and financial guidance to the broader community.
“A clinic of this nature is quite relevant and appropriate within the context of preparing students for the changing world of work. The idea is to get students involved in activities to support the small business owner within an experiential learning space,” said Michelle Esau, Dean: Economic and Management Sciences. “We will bring different stakeholders together -small businesses, agencies, academics, corporate and government - into a space where the primary focus is on supporting the small business owner.”
“Our community members will be able to come to UWC for assistance and in this way, also expose our students to an experiential learning environment. We are therefore not only engaging our communities, but also making a difference in these communities, As such, we are also giving our students a totally different learning experience,” says Prof Lawack.
We need incubators and accelerators to better prepare aspirant entrepreneurs to start their own businesses.
“This will require public-private partnerships, and a collective response to drive entrepreneurial activity. It’s imperative for students to have practical experience within their designated industries,” said Hoffman.
TheZone learning programme therefore also presents corporates with an opportunity to join the journey to promote and foster entrepreneurship among our youth.
For further information about funding and partnering opportunities please contact Dr Jacob Cloete, TheZone Project Manager.
This leadership programme is to develop UWC’s leadership pipeline and to foster peer learning across faculties and administrative support sectors of the university. 
The 2018/2019 P4APL cohort had 24 staff members. The programme had been reviewed to include modules a module Internationalisation and entrepreneurship which took place in April and June respectively. The cohort completed and graduated in September 2019.
The 2019/2020 cohort commenced the programme in October 2019 by completing a battery of self–insight instruments. The initial session was used as both the introduction, cohort formation as well as completion of the self –insight assessments. In early November, the candidates had an opportunity to meet in one on one consultation sessions about their with consultants who generated the reports. 
The cohort is currently meeting and completing modules in an online environment.
Continuing Education (CE) is changing at UWC to keep abreast with global and national developments. With the dawn of the 4th Industrial Revolution, higher education institutions are forced to reimagine their CE learning and teaching approaches to remain relevant and responsive to work and learning demands. For this reason, a more demand-driven approach is required for the provision of our CE courses and programmes. Furthermore, more pressure is placed on universities to develop new forms of sustainable income streams and COVID-19 has forced us to broaden our programme delivery modalities, to include face-to-face contact, blended learning and fully online approaches. 
What do we mean by Continuing Education?
Continuing Education includes all short courses (ranging from a few hours to several weeks), short learning programmes (more than one “module” or phase, and with multiple summative assessment points), workshops that require a certificate, continuing professional development and similar offerings designed to attract recognition by professional and other regulatory bodies, master classes and other university certificate courses, and any other existing or future type of delivery or teaching and learning intervention that corresponds with this definition. 
How are we changing?
Branding Strategy
Exciting new and dynamic branding strategies have been designed to promote the future CE Centre. We have worked closely with colleagues in the university and service providers to advance a more cutting-edge way to learn and teach. An innovative name for the CE Centre has been chosen that emphasises lifelong learning with distinction; a new colourful logo has been selected that represents the seven Faculties as well as the diversity of our communities.
This new brand and logo will be revealed in the next few months at UWC. 
Marketing Strategy
With the assistance of service providers, we are planning a more aggressive marketing strategy to advertise the brand to the market. The marketing strategy will also focus on different mediums to include all age groups and market sectors. This will include enhancing our understanding of the national competitor and pricing landscape.
With the support of our ICT team, a new interactive website is in the process of development that will encourage a positive user-friendly interface experience for potential participants. People will be able to access and view our menu of courses, course dates, prices, modes of delivery, course outlines and admission requirements with greater ease. 
Benefits to Faculties
The administrative burden will be reduced on Faculties. In order to manage risk and increase income opportunities, the new Centre will focus on the marketing; admin responsibilities which include, client enquiries, application, registration and certification processes, events management and logistical arrangements; finance and debt collection. The Centre team will work closely with Faculties and the Registrar’s office. 
Governance and quality assurance of CE Provision
Proper governance and quality management of all CE provision continue to be the responsibility of the Senate Academic Planning Sub-Committee for Continuing Education. This Committee is accountable to the Deputy Vice Chancellor: Academic ensuring that standard operating procedures are followed and the integrity of these processes across the course value chain. Faculties, on the other hand, continue to have internal oversight of the quality assurance processes such as course design and delivery, and the periodic review of all courses and programmes. 
The way forward…
To demonstrate our intention to deliver quality courses, we are aiming to kick off with three pilot courses towards the latter end of Q1 2021. We are currently working closely with the CIECT team to ensure a well-designed platform for the launch of these courses.
We look forward to you joining us on this new and exciting journey as we change the trajectory of Continuing Education at UWC.
Migration and mobilities refers to the contemporary and historical movement of people on various scales around the globe, as well as to the circulation of ideas, objects, and capital that often accompany this mobility.
Migration and Mobilities UWC is a collaborative group across five of the University's faculties and has significant research and teaching capacity on this theme, including: 
the legal and human rights of refugees and migrants
‘spatial’ aspects of mobility in local and ‘translocal’ contexts, such as access to transport and movement in the city
migration and urbanisation
the relationship between migration and development
economic and social histories of mobility
the politics of xenophobia
and migration and decolonisation
Our researchers employ a variety of methods, including quantitative modelling of migration and the tracking of remittances; qualitative research on migrant sociality and livelihoods; and mixed methods approaches to help understand the practices, meanings and impacts of mobilities in the African and global context.
We aim to strengthen partnerships locally, regionally and globally, to promote a new generation of academics and researchers through teaching and capacity building, and to promote social transformation through policy intervention, advocacy and community engagement.

Mindful of its role in providing access to higher education, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) offers opportunities to students who are both academically deserving and financially lacking. These students are mostly drawn from disadvantaged schools that withstand adverse conditions and a lack of resources but possess the will to succeed.
Our department operates from a Central Office that co-ordinates student funding across the university. The Central Office works closely with the faculties and departments across the university to assist students that are financially disadvantaged. 
The Department of Student Funding administers NSFAS funding as well as bursaries and scholarships. As such, we are in a position to assist students with information on funding from NSFAS, bursary sponsors or scholarship opportunities where applicable.
Services to students are provided by the Financial Aid Advisors, based in the Financial Aid Office, behind the administration building (Prefabs) on the UWC main campus. 
Students who require funding information or assistance are encouraged to see their Financial Aid Advisors in their offices, who will gladly provide them with the necessary information.
Student Funding also provides donor liaison services to the various donors who provide funding and valuable support to financially needy and academically deserving students. The Financial Aid Advisors are the primary links with the donors and work closely with the donors assigned to each of them. The Central Office also works in close partnership with the private sector, public sector and non-governmental organisations to welcome and onboard any new sponsors who are keen to provide funding to students at UWC. Our donors are very important to our students, and we value donors who so generously support students of the University of the Western Cape. 
Vision and Mission 
The Financial Aid Office provides access, financial support and advisory services to all deserving students, especially learner intake from previously disadvantaged backgrounds.
The primary function of the Financial Aid Office is to award and manage bursaries and bursary loans according to agreed criteria. The mandate of the Financial Aid Office is aligned to the following institutional principles regarding financial support to students:
The Financial Aid Office strives to balance responsible stewardship of all financial aid funds with the creation of a student-centred culture. 
We are working to establish ourselves as a leader in financial aid services when measured against peer institutions, using technology to streamline financial aid processes and constantly looking forward to meeting challenges resulting from changes in federal, state, institutional and private funding rules and economic changes. 
We seek to model campus-wide communication and collaboration while respecting the needs, values, and diversity of our students, parents, and colleagues

WELCOME TO THE FACULTY OF NATURAL SCIENCES 
Professor David Holgate, Dean: Natural Sciences 
Dear Campus Community
Welcome to the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of the Western Cape! I'm thrilled to extend my warmest greetings to all students and staff, wishing you a fantastic and prosperous 2025.
As a first-year student, you are amongst the select few, approximately 830 students, who have been accepted to study with us in our Faculty. This is an achievement considering the millions of applications received nationwide. To our returning students, your perseverance is commendable, and you're still on your journey! To each and every one of you, we feel proud and enthusiastic about collaborating with you to shape your future.
As you step into our faculty, it's crucial to recognise its profound role in society - and consequently, your role within it. Recent challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, energy crises, and water shortages, have underscored the critical importance of science and technology for global well-being. Despite the uncertainties of the past few years, the world continues to rely on the natural sciences for answers. By choosing the Faculty of Natural Sciences, you've taken the crucial first step toward becoming an intellectual and scholar capable of contributing not only to our Rainbow Nation but to the world at large. With only about 6% of South Africans holding university degrees, being part of this group entails both privilege and responsibility.
Let me give you a brief overview of our Faculty. We house nine academic departments, a School of Pharmacy, four research institutes, two research centres, and two research units. Our 2025 academic program offers ten undergraduate degrees and one professional pharmacy degree. At the postgraduate level, we provide 12 honours degrees, one postgraduate diploma, and numerous master’s and doctoral programs across various scientific disciplines.
Our Faculty is proud to offer innovative and relevant learning and teaching programs at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. We aim to create an environment that fosters intellectual curiosity and encourages debate. Within our Faculty, you'll find scholars recognised nationally and internationally for their leadership and groundbreaking research. We are committed to research that addresses the needs and challenges facing not only our local communities, but also the global community at large.
Our friendly staff are here to support you. Please don't hesitate to seek assistance if you feel lost or uncertain. Remember, asking questions is an integral part of the learning process. We are committed to equipping and graduating students with the skills needed to address societal needs, from the everyday to the monumental challenges like poverty and inequality. Our Faculty is equipped with some of the most state-of-the-art infrastructure and technology available in South Africa, and we want you, as students, to benefit as much as possible from these resources.
American poet Dr. Maya Angelou once said, ""When you learn, teach; when you get, give."" So, remember to work hard and seize your opportunities. Build your student networks, study groups, and encourage each other. South Africa, and indeed Africa, needs to hear your voice.
Lastly, make friends and have fun during your time at UWC. One day, you'll look back and cherish this moment in your life. Don't let it slip away.
Once again, welcome to YOUR Faculty of Natural Sciences. Let's embark on this journey together.
Yours Sincerely,
Professor David Holgate

Niche Area 
Welcome to the Biodiversity and Conservation Biology Department homepage. The department was formed as an amalgamation of the former Botany and Zoology departments. Our location at the southern tip of Africa places us in an ideal position for field research into a host of interesting plants and animals. 
The simplest definition of biotechnology is “applied biology” through the application of biological knowledge and techniques to develop products or services. It may be further defined as the use of living organisms to make a product or run a process. By this definition, the classic techniques used for plant and animal breeding, fermentation and enzyme purification are to be considered biotechnology. 
Chemistry is often described as the central science because it touches all the other sciences. 
Our vision is to provide innovative programmes in Computer Science, in order empowering our graduates to advance the quality of life in Africa. 
The Department of Earth Sciences at UWC offers challenging opportunities in the nationally strategic areas of natural resources combining the disciplines of Applied geology, environmental and water sciences. These rapidly expanding programmes have established an international profile through teaching and research. Our research aim as a department is to study fundamental processes, and to investigate linkage between different components of the earth system (solid earth, hydrosphere, biosphere and atmosphere). 
The Department of Mathematics offers programs for undergraduate and post graduate degrees. We have established programs of fundamental research in mathematics, as well as research in various areas such as Mathematical Modelling, Financial Mathematics and Mathematics Education among others. 
In the Department of Medical Biosciences, we aim at training and developing scientists who will conduct research with a view to reduce the many lifestyle associated diseases.
To prepare students, the Medical Biosciences programme teaches students anatomy, physiology and medical microbiology thereby providing an understanding of the structure and function of the human body, and how the body protects itself against disease. 
The Physics and Astronomy Department carries out physics and provides teaching programmes that will contribute significantly to the development of human capacity, science and technology in South Africa. The study of Physics and Astronomy at UWC produces holistically educated citizens who understand our rapidly changing technological world. Our vision is to see our graduates be equipped with the fundamental knowledge of physics, problem solving, life and communication skills. 
Welcome to the Statistics and Population Studies Department at the University of the Western Cape.
Our Department revolves around two axes of teaching and research: Statistics with specialisation in Data Science and Population Studies. Two growing and important fields as data become more and more used everywhere and every day for planning purposes and to understand the challenges of our modern societies: from stock markets, medical research, economic forecasting to human populations. 
The UNESCO Chair in Hydrogeology was established in 2001 at UWC following the introduction of the National Water Act of 1998 by the National Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF). As the Chair mainly focuses on groundwater related education, research and outreach, the Centre strives to contribute towards sustainable utilisation of groundwater resources in South Africa, Africa and the developing world.
The Institute for Microbial Biotechnology and Metagenomics is headed by Professor Marla Trindade as Director. Recognised as one of the leading research units at UWC, IMBM forms part of the Department of Biotechnology. IMBM is dedicated to excellence in research and in the training of future research leaders. In addition, it contributes to the Department’s undergraduate teaching activities. 
The Institute for Water Studies (IWS) at the University of the Western Cape was formed in 2009 with the goal of promoting research, postgraduate training, and outreach on water related issues through the collaborative efforts of UWC staff. The Institute for Water Studies aims to increase the understanding of surface water, groundwater, and ecosystems linkages and how water users are affected and affect these linkages. 
South African Institute for Advanced Materials Chemistry (SAIAMC) at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), established in 2004, comprises three distinct and closely interrelated programmes: Hydrogen South Africa Systems Integration Competence Centre (HySA Systems), PetroSA Synthetic Fuels Innovation Centre (PSFIC) and Energy Storage and Fluid Treatment Centre (ESFTC) 
Bioinformatics is a specialist discipline straddling the fields of biology, mathematics and computer science and it is integral to modern biological research. The South African National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI) is a research institute reporting through the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) in Cape Town.
Our primary focus is the development and implementation of computational methodologies which allow researchers to accelerate their genomics data analyses. SANBI aims to heighten awareness of bioinformatics in South Africa and to assist the country in making optimal use of bioinformatics tools. 
The Inter-university Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy is a partnership of three South African universities, the Universities of Cape Town, of the Western Cape and of Pretoria. IDIA also has an industry partner in SAP. 
Pharmacists play meaningful roles in the healthcare of people. They do this through emphasis on correct and rational use of medicines and related products. Pharmacists remain in high demand in the public and private sectors. The corporate part is expanding and the demand for pharmacists continues. This applies to South Africa and other countries of the world.
Proteomics is the term that describes a multitude of tools and expertise used primarily to profile and identify proteins of interest in any organism at a large scale. Proteins of interests include biomarkers for certain diseases or physiological/developmental status. For example, one could use proteomics to investigate effects of pathogens on organ protein expression levels and patterns. 
The UWC Nature Reserve Unit provides an educational and recreational asset for the University of the Western Cape’s staff and students as well as surrounding communities by functioning as a base for ecological teaching, environmental education and research.
Our role is to develop an awareness and understanding by reconnecting students with nature, to inspire them to find a new appreciation for their natural surroundings, thus having an important bearing on future decision-making by the same individuals. 
The Department of Science and Innovation identified nanoscience as an important new field that South Africa needs to develop.
As such, they introduced a dedicated postgraduate programme for training in nanoscience and nanotechnology. 
UWC has collaborated with an international software developer to offer the first of its kind postgraduate diploma in South Africa. This accredited postgraduate diploma in e-skills with immersive technologies stream can provide you with a hands-on approach to learning VR & AR software design and development skills, empowering you to join an exciting new field in the Fourth Industrial revolution (4IR) that is gaining a vast amount of interest globally."

Welcome to uDubs Res!
Standards for Community Living in Residences 
Give Respect. Get Respect.
The Bill of Rights (Chapter One, South African Constitution) guarantees that our human rights be respected and that it is defendable in a court of law. A human rights context though, suggests that there are strong community ties that help to ensure that the rights of all will be respected and that tolerance is shown when minding the rights of others – community members decide to tolerate and respect and are not purely governed by law. The Bill of Rights also suggests that with each right, comes responsibility.
The Bill of Human Rights echoes the spirit of Ubuntu– I am because we are and because we are, you are. We are people in the context of others.We can insist that others respect our rights, but we must also be tolerant of others’ rights. Tolerance in the SA Constitution may be described as: 
Showing respect towards others
Using negotiation and mediation techniques when there is a problem between two or more people
Being patient and a good listener with other people
Understanding that everyone has a right to an opinion
Rules for Community Living
Alcohol Drinks, Drugs, Intoxicating Substances and Illegal Prescription Medication
The university affirms and promotes community wide norms that support abstinence and encourage low risk life choices regarding alcohol, drugs, intoxicating substances, and prescription medication for non-medicinal purposes. It furthermore affirms and protects choices that don’t compromise positive living and learning experiences of the university’ community. 
No intoxicating substances in the university residences or at any official function, excursion or tour.
It is strictly prohibited for any student to sell alcohol in his/her room or in the vicinity of the residences.

FIRST YEAR TRANSITION OFFICER SUPPORT
""To be a FYTO, means to help first year students navigate their way through university by providing them with the necessary support in terms of their academic, social and personal challenges. The university environment is very different from the high school environment, so it becomes important to provide the necessary guidance to ensure that the transition from high school to university is as smooth as possible. This will allow the students to not only survive their first year, but also to thrive. To the first years, your academics are important, so be goal-oriented, but also ensure that you look after your mental and physical wellbeing. Remember there will be days when you won't feel motivated, so learn to be disciplined.""

FROM MENTOR TO OVERSEAS: SUCCESS STORY
""During my first year at university, I struggled with adjusting to being far from home, being in different environments, and forming relationships with my classmates in varsity. That made it hard for me to adjust to varsity life and I felt I had no one to turn to. I applied for a mentor and received assistance and that motivated me to apply for the mentor position. I wanted to assist students who are struggling as well. During my first year of being a mentor, everything became virtual due to COVID-19. It was a huge adjustment for everyone, but that did not stop me from being a dedicated mentor. I always tried to have weekly sessions with my mentees. Firstly, to check up on them and discuss the challenges they had been facing. I would share my experiences with them and how I was tackling every situation.
This made the environment feel safe as they did not feel judged. In areas where I felt I could not assist, I would reach out to my FYTO and she was always willing to assist. This has helped me grow in my career as an emerging physiotherapist as it improved my communication skills, ability to empathise with patients and work in multidisciplinary teams. To this day I am still in communication with my previous mentees and FYTO because of the relationship I built with them.""

FIRST YEAR MENTOR EXPERIENCE
""The First Year Transition Programme has provided me with numerous benefits, memories and most importantly support for my 3 years on university. I started my tertiary journey in 2021 as a mentor. The knowledge and insights I gained as a mentee has driven me to become a mentor. As a mentor I developed personally and professionally. The FYTP offered me guidance, knowledge, and expertise from experienced individuals who have already navigated similar paths.This includes sharing specific insights, problem-solving strategies, and practical advice. The programme helped me navigate challenges and overcome obstacles more effectively. Lastly, the programme has provided me with a space to elevate my self-esteem and confidence which has shaped the way I grew at university.""

Education First Year Mentor
FROM MENTEE TO MENTOR
""Two years of mentoring first year students has been an immensely fulfilling experience. After overcoming my own obstacles in my first year, it seemed like the right decision to enroll in the programme. It was a comfort to be able to ask for help and support, and changing from being a mentee to a mentor gave me a fresh viewpoint. I was able to meaningfully help first-year students since I had firsthand experience with their problems. I strongly advise anyone who is having difficulties or is just looking for a student guide, to enroll in the programme. This guidance goes beyond short-term setbacks, cultivates relationships, and has a long-lasting effect on mentors and mentees.""
Haylen
Community and Health Sciences First Year Mentor
ADVICE FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS
""I encourage first years to join the programme. To first years, I recommend to take your time. Life isn't a sprint. It's a marathon, this applies to varsity too. Come in with an open mind, ready to learn not for your course but about life, yourself, and others. You might learn new things and unlearn things, all of that is normal. Be ready to engage with your environment and the people, be willing to take up opportunities as they come to you, and continuously work on yourself and your mental health.""
Lufezo
Arts and Humanities First Year Mentor
ACADEMIC
""The FYTP really helped me with adjusting to my first year. I learn't a lot about my degree and the career paths available to me. I learn't how to study efficiently, and thanks to my mentor, I have learn't about the various places on campus where I can study between my classes.""
First Year Mentee
SOCIAL
""I would like to thank FTYP for giving me an opportunity to be a mentee. I really enjoyed it and I had an awesome mentor. It was helpful to me mentally. I'm not antisocial like how I used to be before I joined the programme. It changed my life and I wish one day I can be part of the programme maybe be a mentor and help first year students.""

The student population at South African universities have changed dramatically in the last two decades. It’s now much more diverse in terms of age, race, culture, backgrounds, educational experience and academic potential.
This transformation has brought with it a wide variety of student expectations – largely influenced by their school experience, family background and home communities – about...

FIXING THE FIRST-YEAR EXPERIENCE: STUDYING STUDENT SUCCESS AT UWC
One of the greatest challenges in higher education is simply ensuring that students make it through their university careers and graduate on time - and that challenge begins in first-year where there’s often a clash between what students expect, and what they actually experience at university
“One of the biggest challenges for universities dealing with first-years is simply knowing what it is they expect of us,” says Dr Subethra Pather, who heads the First-Year Experience programme at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). “The mismatch between expectation and reality can...

Under its Director, Dr Juliet Stoltenkamp, the centre positions itself within the context of global transformation of higher education institutions (HEIs) in response to a wave of dynamic education sector reforms. These include the adoption of emerging technologies to enhance teaching-and-learning practices, education management, research and administration. This situation has placed a strain on HEIs in South Africa and elsewhere, due to changing societal needs and expectations, the inevitable integration of technology, and specifically online learning and blended learning interventions; and at the same time, the increasing pressure on practitioners to deliver quality education. 
Consequently, a need has arisen for ePedagogy training and support for academics and students within challenging, complex HEI settings. Equally important is indeed the constructive impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on flexible teaching, learning and assessment practices.
CIECT’s integrated Professional Support team is structured around the niche areas of: 
We are excited to welcome to all students, parents, extended families and guardians and invite you to attend our upcoming face-to-face and online orientation sessions for 2025. Some of the exciting features of studying at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) is that lecturers and tutors make use of blended teaching and learning approaches. Students are able to engage in content, communicate and complete assessments, and exams online (from any location), by making use of the institutional Learning Management System (LMS), known as iKamva.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/learning-and-teaching/community-engagement-unit,"Community Engagement Unit | UWC
The Community Engagement Unit (CEU) at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), under its director Prof Priscilla Daniels, facilitates community engagement opportunities that enhances and promotes the scholarship of engagement through equitable partnerships and citizenry to promote sustainable communities.
Our commitment to community engagement with societal impact is reflected in the history and ethos of the UWC. As this university embraces its proud history in the anti-apartheid movements, it is committed to link this proud past to an exciting future grounded in excellence with local, regional, and international relevance.
The scholarship of engagement relates to the wide range of ‘work’ (i.e. community engagement) that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) do in partnership with different ‘communities’ (e.g. scholarly community, student community, civil society, and international community).
HEIs have a longstanding tradition of teaching, research, and community engagement. Globally contemporary HEIs are required to make a fundamental contribution to the development of civil society infused by relevant, innovative scholarly research and academic endeavours, steeped in the three-part legislated role of HEIs.
Community engagement is the pivotal point that feeds into and from teaching and research, and the link between these three legislative roles are equally important based on partnership and inclusivity.

Units in the Directorate
The University of the Western Cape has pioneered as a leader in the policy development and implementation of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) within South Africa’s higher education landscape. RPL is an integral part of the Admissions Policy at UWC and finds expression in a range of services to support mature students (23 years and older) seeking alternative access into higher education degree programmes at UWC. 
“Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is the formal acknowledgement of the knowledge, skills, competence, expertise and capabilities that people possess as a result of prior learning that may have occurred through formal, informal or non-formal means, through self-study, work or other life experiences.” 
The domain of RPL is aligned to the main elements of the South African national policy discourse since 1994, with a specific focus of achieving transformation; accreditation; lifelong learning; and complying with the National qualifications framework (NQF) of South Africa. The main purpose of RPL is to facilitate access to, mobility across and progression within education, training and career paths.

The University of the Western Cape’s Writing Centre ​​aims to help student writers to develop their academic reading and writing practices in a constructive and supportive academic space. Trained peer writing tutors help students to develop, revise and refine their writing assignment before it has to be submitted for assessment.
The Writing Centre works in collaboration with the students through asking questions, engaging in discussion and giving advice and guidance. The writing centre also provides advice and support to staff.

UWC Transforms Its Identity: From ‘Bushies’ to ‘Caracals’
For decades, members of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) community, particularly those involved in sports, have colloquially been referred to as “Bushies”.
However, for some, this term carries apartheid connotations, is considered derogatory, and lacks any substance.
With these concerns in mind, the university’s leadership has decided to bid farewell to the old moniker and embrace a fresh identity: the Caracals.
This new name draws inspiration from the stealthy wild cat which roams the university’s nature reserve.
Mandla Gagayi, UWC’s Director of Sport and a member of the renaming committee, explained: “The caracal’s characteristics mirror those of UWC students and staff — resilient, agile, well-honed and capable of punching above its weight. You will be surprised how a caracal takes down an animal twice its size. Our unique animal is right here on our doorstep, representing what we stand for. Let’s embrace that name.”
Gagayi noted that some alumni have long voiced concerns about using the term “Bushies” and that the association with this term and their past experiences could be why some are reluctant to participate in university activities.
Recognising the need for change, the university initiated a renaming process in 2021 involving various departments and committees.
“The term ‘Bushies’ is not even an official name; it’s not part of any institutional policy. It’s simply a term that supporters and individuals adopted. This made it easier for us to navigate the change, as we’re not altering policy but merely shifting the narrative,” Gagayi said.
A thorough consultation process ensued, with the university community submitting proposed names and motivations. Despite over 30 suggestions, the name “caracal” emerged consistently, with diverse motivations, yet all aligned with the essence of UWC.
The university is now in the final stages of procuring the new Caracal mascot, complete with graphics that encapsulate the institution's spirit.
Gagayi emphasised that this change is crucial for the university’s transformation, which is part of a broader redress process.
“We cannot cling to the artefacts of apartheid; they must find a place in the archives or museums while we introduce things that are representative of the current times. This shift represents our commitment to moving forward as a formerly disadvantaged university.”
Gagayi also encouraged the university community to embrace the new mascot by incorporating it into various events. 
Director of the Department for Institutional Advancement Professor Anesh Singh echoed Gagayi’s sentiments and said the name change tells few stories.
“It is a name shift but also talks about the uniqueness of UWC as well as the natural fauna and flora we have on campus. UWC is the third greenest campus in Africa.”
Prof Singh added that symbolism is important, and imaging the caracal will be more straightforward.
“Nobody knew how the Bushie should look like. At least it’s easier with the caracal. Its strength lies in the winning streak. Now, we will shift branding and make it more visible on campus and in the public domain.”"

The recently merged Research Development and Postgraduate Support (RDPS) Office serves as a strategic department to grow the University of the Western Cape’s capacity for innovative, ground-breaking research.
We serve as a catalyst to promote, support, strengthen and grow the research enterprise at UWC. We aim to achieve this by providing an inclusive, multicultural and holistic research development services and resources to faculty, staff, postdoctoral fellows and postgraduate students that stimulate research and other creative endeavours. We also aim to facilitate and enhance partnerships and collaborations between faculty, postgraduate students, government, foundations, industry, and global research enterprises.
Our postgraduate support ensures that the Institutional Operating Plan (IOP) mandate of UWC is accomplished for staff research outputs and postgraduate students recruitment, retention and throughput. We are key role players in developing infrastructure and policy that promote creativity and entrepreneurial culture at UWC.
The Converis™ system facilitates the consolidation of research information and internal procedures by combining data from both external and internal sources under a unified platform. Converis provides a comprehensive strategy that encompasses the entirety of the research lifecycle, spanning from pre-award through post-award stages.
Our office uses Converis ™ system to track publications of our academics at UWC. This task involves the collection, validation, and reporting of research publications. It also includes the tracking of bibliographic metadata and full-text content, which include integration with Open Access repositories.

UWC in Varsity Sports
The University of the Western Cape are one of the founder members of the University Sports Company (USC) which, in 2012, saw the establishment of Varsity Sports – a high performance competition that enables South African universities to compete against one another in a number of different sporting codes.
As it happened, UWC were among the first tournament winners. They claimed the inaugural Varsity Beach Volleyball series in 2012 which took place alongside Varsity 7s Rugby in Plettenberg Bay and Margate. Over the years, UWC established themselves as the powerhouse of university beach volleyball, claiming four of the five titles – 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 – before the code was discontinued after the 2017 event.
The men's football team won the Varsity Football title in 2015 in front of a capacity crowd at UWC Sports Stadium – aka the Operation Room and won it again in 2024. The women, meanwhile, featured in four finals (2015, 2016, 2018, 2019) before – in 2021 – finally claiming another Varsity Sports title for the University. The women then reclaimed their crown in 2023 and 2024. in 2024 UWC Women's Football became the first university to qualify for COSAFA and CAF Champions League. In 2024 UWC Womens Football were crowned the champions of COSAFA in Malawi.
UWC have also excelled themselves in other Varsity Sports codes. They reached the final of the 2015 cricket tournament and 2016 sevens rugby competition and individuals have shone during athletics meetings. UWC teams have also competed in Varsity Netball and Varsity Basketball, leaving only hockey and mountain bike as the codes the University has yet to to compete in.

UWC in Varsity Cup/Shield
When FNB Varsity Shield was established in 2011, as a second-tier competition below FNB Varsity Cup, UWC (initially coached by current Springboks assistant Deon Davids) were among the five ‘expansion’ teams.
The first two years saw the boys in blue and gold have to settle for third place (to miss out on the final), but in 2012 Charlton van Jaarsveld was named as the Forward That Rocks while Cheslyn Roberts was in a three-way tie as top try scorer courtesy of his six efforts.
With ex-Springboks coach Peter de Villiers taking the coaching reins in 2013, UWC finished second, but FNB CUT used home ground advantage to get the better of the them in the final, triumphing 29-19. Individually, Freddie Muller finished as the top points scorer (70) and was chosen as the Back That Rocks.
Their form tailed off in 2014 when they finished fourth, before improving to third in 2015 when James Verity-Amm scored a tournament-high 11 tries [which remains a single tournament record].
UDubs’ second-place finish in 2016, when Springboks legend Chester Williams took over from De Villiers, handed them the opportunity of promotion to the Varsity Cup, but Wits scuppered that by winning the final 39-2. Again, in part consolation, UWC supplied the Back That Rocks in Aidynn Cupido.
The boys in blue and gold’s spirit wasn’t broken as they claimed the title in 2017 (when the competition expanded to seven teams), convincingly beating FNB UFH 45-2 in a home final. More significantly, with promotion on the line again in 2018, coach Chester’s boys played a perfect season winning all six round-robin matches before thumping FNB WSU 55-10 in the final to set off celebrations at the Operation Room.
UWC may have finished bottom in their debut Varsity Cup campaign in 2019, but they at least broke the winless season ‘hoodoo’ suffered by previous promoted teams by securing a win against FNB UJ.
The untimely death of Chester Williams in late 2019 rocked more than just the UWC rugby community and it was perhaps unsurprising that the team spluttered in 2020, before the season was curtailed by the Coronavirus pandemic.
The arrival of former Springboks Sevens player and coach Paul Treu (and UWC alumnus) has brought renewed energy to the team. This much was in evidence in a 2021 campaign when they finished sixth and Tinotenda Mavesere claimed the Forward That Rocks award and finishing runner-up in Overall Player That Rocks voting.
Unfortunately, UWC fell foul of the combined 2021-22 log and played in the FNB Varsity Shield in 2023.
It was only to be a one-season stay however, as an unbeaten season saw them top the round-robin log and claim automatic promotion before back-to-back semifinal and final (against neighbours CPUT) wins saw them add silverware to end a fantastic campaign.

The Centre of Excellence in Food Security (CoE-FS) undertakes innovative research and critical enquiry to enable South Africa to tackle the challenges of food insecurity and nutrition. Food insecurity is caused by a number of factors ranging from a lack of income with which to purchase sufficient calories and nutrients, to the inability of a county or region to provide affordable food to its population, to constraints on the physical environment limiting the production of food such as water scarcity, poor soil quality and climate change. Accordingly, research at the CoE-FS is transdisciplinary in nature. Through established networks (nationally, regionally and globally) and collaborative approaches; our research examines the scale, nature, causes and consequences of food insecurity in South Africa, and elsewhere on the African continent.
Our collaborative approach recognises the importance of drawing insights from the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, as well as stakeholders’ knowledge, to find solutions to the complexities associated with achieving food security and nutrition for all. Our goal is to improve food security and nutrition, through linking innovative science with critical enquiry and implementation strategies, such as; addressing development priorities as set out in South Africa’s National Development Plan, continent-wide frameworks such as Agenda 2063, and global calls to action such as the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG2: “End hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition”.

Overview
""No man is an island, entire of itself. Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."" – John Donne (1572-1631) from Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, and several steps in my Sickness - Meditation XVII, 1624
This acclaimed poem’s concept of mankind’s inherent connection to others is universally recognised, and clearly epitomised in the African concept of Ubuntu. What they bring into focus is that we do not thrive on our own, and that co-existing happily with others requires respect, tolerance and consideration.
This is why society is governed by rules and guidelines, and institutions like ours have regulations which need to be adhered to not only ensure the smooth flow of daily operations, but also that all members of our community are treated with dignity and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that their rights as humans are upheld.
The Gender Equity Unit forms an integral part of ensuring that the university’s rules, regulations, principles and policies are upheld, thereby ensuring that your stay at University of the Western Cape becomes one of your most treasured memories.
Browse this section for useful information on the policies the GEU monitors, and our anti-discrimination programmes and activities. 
About Us
The Gender Equity Unit’s activities and programmes are geared towards making sure that no one is discriminated against, harassed or hurt because of their gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation, and to facilitating the empowerment of particularly women and other marginalised groups, both on campus and within society at large.​
Our Mission
The Gender Equity Unit promotes Women and Gender equity and social justice through feminist research, education and advocacy in the University of the Western Cape and beyond.
Our Vision
The leading Gender Equity Unit recognised for its feminist intellectual activism and capacitating societies towards ensuring equity in all spheres of life.
Our Aims
1) Ensure Women’s and Gender equity in all spheres of life
2) Promote social justice and human rights
3) Enhance the students’ experience to facilitate successfully through raising awareness and education
4) Equipping the University of the Western Cape community and broader communities to become informed, conscious, and active citizens with regard to Women and Gender issues
5) Conduct relevant research to advance the thought leadership and influence 
Our History
Women and Gender concerns at the University of the Western Cape were addressed within a very specific context. In the mid-1980s, when the country was still embroiled in the liberation struggle, women and gender issues were of lesser concern than the bigger issue of human rights. However, a small group of feminists – and men supporting feminism – at the university were deeply concerned about the structural inequities that existed between women and men on campus and set about advocating change. ​
These inequities included disparities in salaries between women and men; men generally earned more than women; women did not receive housing subsidies; there was no maternity leave for women; there were no promotion opportunities for women; women could not go on sabbaticals and all the professors were male with white men in the most senior professorships.
Feminists were concerned about the lack of substantive equity. Issues with regard to bodily integrity, reproductive health and safety and security were of the first items on the transformative agenda for women on campus. As one woman lecturer commented: 'I practically gave birth in the classroom.' During the mid-eighties the then Rector, Jakes Gerwel, was approached by women staff to address their equity concerns. Subsequently a Women's Commission was formed in the late eighties that drew up a list of discriminatory practices, proposals to address them and submitted it to the Rector, Senate and Council.
The list included issues around maternity benefits, housing subsidy, childcare facilities, a sexual harassment policy and the safety for women on campus. Systematically public presentations were made and gains were achieved. The university management was compelled to become more supportive and gender-sensitive in their dealings with women. Women's concerns became part of the broad political social transformative discourse at the university.
In 1993, the Gender Equity Unit was formally established and the first Gender Equity Coordinator, Rhoda Kadalie, was appointed. The Unit was established with seed funding from the Ford Foundation. It was realised that the broader national liberation movement under the auspices of the Mass Democratic Movement did not include the liberation of women. The denial of women's liberation was acutely felt on campus as many of these activist organizations were based at the University of the Western Cape during the height of apartheid. Many of the women on campus were also involved in United Women's Congress; the African National Congress Women's League and the United Democratic Front. There was therefore a keen political awareness of the marginalization of women's concerns. The university is well known as a site of struggle against the apartheid regime.
Women students on campus were also particularly aware of the oppression of women. Collette Solomons, an anthropology honours student, submitted a mini thesis: 'Sexism at the University of the Western Cape: with reference to progressive student organizations'. This thesis evoked strong debates because it focused on issues of rape and harassment amongst the student population on campus and it challenged the notion of justice and respect for women students.
Women students demanded that gender justice be included in the quest for democracy in the students' struggle for freedom.
The pressure for the university to become inclusive of women's rights as human rights came from both the students and staff. The Gender Equity Unit staff started to hold countless public debates, forced the student disciplinary committees to change, conducted awareness raising workshops, educated and trained student leadership and hosted extensive conscientising programmes in the residences to transform the gender hostile climate on campus.
By the mid-nineties the University of the Western Cape had the best maternity benefits in the country, five months fully-paid leave and seven days paternity leave for men; housing subsidies for married women; chief invigilation duties for women; and an educare centre for children of staff. The unit also developed a Sexual Harassment Policy; a Gender Policy and a Non-Sexist Language Policy. Resource booklets on sexual harassment were developed and distributed. Ad hominem promotion was granted to women academics, and they for the first time had equitable access to study leave and research funding. A Women's and Gender Studies Programme was also established.
Women students formed a volunteer group, called Kopanang and began to raise gender awareness amongst students. UWC became the centre for women and gender awareness raising in the country well in advance of the post-apartheid liberal language framework and rhetoric. 
Programmes
Food Programme
The Gender Equity Unit’s Food Programme seek to encourage both students and staff to be generous and provide non-perishable food items that are redistributed to students who fall completely through the safety net. These are students who often are not eligible for NSFAS and who is not a recipient of a bursary or scholarship and does not receive any financial support from other sources such as family.
HumaNature
HumaNature is a programme that raises awareness on campus around matters affecting people who are differently-abled. The programme promotes awareness by providing students and staff access to South African Sign Language Classes, exposing students and staff to the lived realities of people who are differently-abled by frequent visits to non-governmental and community-based organisations advancing their interests and attending an annual breakfast in the dark as hosted by Cape Town Society for the Blind.
Imbewu
Imbewu is a student-run newsletter that encourages students to write critically about their experiences and surroundings on campus. The newsletter publishes various writings including poetry, personal reflections, reviews and critical pieces. It always seeks to provide alternative narratives to the dominant narratives undermining the politics of the marginalised.

Its research activities address the development and implementation of high-throughput screening methods to prioritize biomarkers for health intervention. The research activities are centred around tuberculosis genomics research, malaria and trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness.
SARChISA-UK Bilateral Chair in Social Protection for Food Security
The bilateral SA-UK SARChI Chair in Social Protection for Food Security is intended to be a global leader in research on food security and nutrition in Africa, and aims to promote international exchange and cooperation. Dr Stephen Devereux has held the SA-UK SARChI Chair in Social Protection for Food Security since 2016. A Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK, Dr Devereux is also based at UWC’s Institute for Social Development, and affiliated to the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Food Security. The Chair addresses questions on why food insecurity in South Africa remains so high, despite the comprehensive social protection system, and how to improve the impact of social protection on hunger.
SARChI Chair in Health Systems Complexity and Change
South African health systems are complex, and must overcome the legacies of both colonialism and apartheid. Prof Asha George of UWC’s School of Public Health has held the SARChI Chair in Health Systems Complexity and Social Change since 2016, and has the tough task of researching (from a governance, gender and human rights perspective) and reforming a system which was never set up to adequately serve the majority of the country. The Chair focuses on four streams of interlinking research: (1) gender, intersectionality and social power relations; (2) community health systems and how they are governed; (3) frontline health workers’ lived realities; and (4) multi-sectoral policy development and implementation that more holistically address social determinants within health systems.
SARChI Chair in Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS)
Professor Ruth Hall holds the South African Research Chair in Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies, which is funded by the National Research Foundation. The Chair is located at the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies (PLAAS) at the University of the Western Cape. Professor Hall has initiated a five-year research programme (2020-2024) on dynamics of agrarian change and rural transformations in Africa. The Research Chair will include work on the character of smallholder agriculture and accumulation dynamics in agriculture and the rural non-farm economy, and will address questions of changing agro-food systems; resource access; rights and governance; land use and production; class formation; social differentiation; and the broader politics of land and agrarian reform.
The SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory
The SARChI Chair in Visual History and Theory, awarded to Professor Patricia Hayes in 2015, explores the challenges faced in visual studies, investigating key methodological and epistemological questions, as well as issues of civil engagement and representation through popular arts or social media. Specific paradigms and postgraduate research associated with the Chair now include documentary photography; liberation struggles and the post-apartheid; digital photography in the postcolony; and photography and historical method. A scholar of African history, gender studies and visuality, Patricia Hayes began research on photography and the question of history after completing her PhD. As Chair, her starting point was to address the huge neglect of rich photographic archives in South Africa and the subcontinent in terms of historical and humanities research.
SARChI Chair in Nano-Electrochemistry and Sensor Technology (NEST)
Established in 2012, the SARChI Chair in Nano-Electrochemistry and Sensor Technology is held by Senior Chemistry Professor Emmanuel Iwuoha, co-head (along with fellow SARChI Chair Prof Priscilla Baker) of UWC’s SensorLab, which focuses on research in smart materials, electrocatalysis, sensors and electrochemical energy. The Chair’s focus is on designing ‘smart’ nanomaterials (polymeric, dendritic, graphenated and carbon nanotube composite systems). Professor Iwuoha has coordinated the National Nanoscience Postgraduate Teaching and Training Platform, an inter-university initiative offering a Master’s degree in nanoscience. He leads a research project on sensors, which aims to produce easy-to-use tools for point-of-care clinical applications, and the acquisition of data necessary for setting quality standards for priority pollutants in food, drinking water and the environment, as well as for monitoring compliance to set such standards.
FirstRand/NRF Chair in Mathematics Education
Professor Cyril Julie is a long-serving member of the Faculty of Education at UWC and now occupies the position of the FirstRand/NRF Chair in Mathematics Education. Unlike most SARChI Chairs, this Chair is not only research-based, but also has a strong developmental component, aiming to improve the skills and knowledge of maths teachers in the basic education system. Prof Julie’s interrelated research interests include elementary mathematics from an advanced point of view and advanced mathematics from an elementary point of view, and the systematic review of issues in maths teaching and learning (among others). These interests stem from the conviction that the enhancement of high-quality teaching will lead to an improvement of learning - and ultimately an improvement in maths results achieved by school learners.
SARChI Chair in Astronomy and Astrophysics
Professor Roy Maartens is an NRF A-Rated researcher (UWC’s first ever, since 2012) in UWC’s Department of Physics and Astronomy, and has championed the University’s involvement with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Since 2011, he has held the SKA/SARChI Chair in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and has built a team of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers with the aim of using SKA to explore fundamental properties of the Universe. He is working on a research project using the power of the SKA pathfinders and the SKA itself to map the distribution of galaxies in the universe. With these maps, researchers aim to resolve the nature of the Dark Energy that forces the universe to expand faster and faster, a major puzzle in modern physics.
Desmond Tutu Research Chair in Religion and Social Justice
In November 2018 Professor Sarojini Nadar (NRF B rated scholar) was appointed as the Desmond Tutu Research Chair in Religion and Social Justice, under a bilateral cooperation agreement between the National Research Foundation SARChi initiative and the Lund Mission Society. Prof. Nadar graduated with a BA degree from the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1996. Her majors were in English Literature and Religious Studies. She obtained a Bachelor of Social Science (Honours) in 1997 and her Masters of Arts in 2000 in the area of Biblical Literature, also at UCT. She obtained her PhD in 2003 at the age of 27 from the erstwhile University of Natal (now UKZN). While she was still undertaking her PhD, she was the coordinator of the International Network in Advanced Theological Education (INATE) from 2002-2005. The network was based in 8 countries and spanned five continents. In 2008, she was appointed to a permanent position as the Director of the Gender and Religion programme which she co-founded. She returned to this position in 2014 after a two-year tenure as the Dean of Research in the College of Humanities in 2012 and 2013. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011 and Full Professor in 2014.
SARChI Chair in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
Professor Joy Papier, Director of UWC’s Institute for Post-School Studies (IPSS), was appointed as the first SARChI Chair in Technical and Vocational Education and Training in 2017 to bring a new focus and impetus to the historically marginalised TVET field. The Chair recognizes the critical and poorly-understood role of post-schooling in addressing South Africa’s development needs, and is intended to guide research, teaching and social engagement regarding the challenges which inhibit South Africa’s youth and adults from reaching their full potential. The work of the Chair, Prof Papier believes, is to shine a light on student experiences of vocational education, and to focus on home-grown solutions to African TVET challenges.
SARChI Chair in Development Of Human Capabilities and Social Cohesion
Through The Family Professor Nicolette Roman heads the Child and Family Studies Programme at UWC where she specialises in individual and family psychological well-being, family functioning and practices, parenting, self-determination theory, research design and writing methods. As SARChI Chair in Development Of Human Capabilities and Social Cohesion Through The Family, a position she was awarded in 2018, her initial focus will be to investigate, explore and understand the status quo and the pathways between the variables both internal and external to the family. That information will be integrated in order to develop guidelines for enhancing human capabilities and social cohesion through the family. The target participants will be the individuals (across the lifespan), family (as a group), policies and stakeholders (including programme implementers, professionals, government).
SARChI Chair in Cosmology with Multi-Wavelength Data
Prof. Mario Santos was appointed as the SARChI Chair in Cosmology with Multi-Wavelength Data on 1 January 2018. He completed his Master’s in Physics/Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 1999 and went on to complete his PhD in Physics at the University of Oxford in 2002.

Nowadays he is concentrating on big data, managing the challenge of the massive datasets generated by MeerKAT and the SKA as the director for the Inter-University Institute for Data-Intensive Astronomy (IDIA).
SARChI Chair in Nuclear Physics
Professor Smarajit Triambak joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UWC from the University of Delhi, India, as the first SARChI Chair in Nuclear Physics in 2013. His research expertise is in the field of accelerator-based, low-energy experimental nuclear physics, most of which revolves around measurements of observables with high accuracy and precision. These investigations, mostly in the sub-fields of weak interactions and nuclear astrophysics, are used to probe for and set stringent limits on hitherto unknown physics, beyond the standard model – an approach that is complementary to high-energy collider experiments. The research chair has enabled Prof Triambak to take his students to world-renowned facilities inside South Africa and beyond.
SARChI Chair in Microbial Genomics
The Institute for Microbial Biotechnology and Metagenomics (IMBM) hosts the DST/NRF SARChI Research Chair in Microbial Genomics, held since 2014 by IMBM Director - and Distinguished Young Woman Scientist Award winner - Professor Marla Trindade. The Chair’s major research focus is to use high-throughput and metagenomic technologies to directly access all microbial genomes in any given environment, from the viruses inhabiting human skin to the extremophiles found in environments too hot, salty or otherwise inhospitable for other life. These will enable the exploration of all information and data that microorganisms can offer biotechnology and present infinite bioprospecting possibilities. Prof Trindade’s research interest is not only in viruses and bacteria on a microscopic level, but in using the genetic information of viruses and other microorganisms in useful real-world applications."

In order to continue to develop the pipeline for NRF SARChI Chairs, the DVC for Research and Innovation initiated the UWC Research Chairs.
The aim of the UWC Research Chairs is to provide leading researchers with the opportunity to contribute to developing their respective niche areas; enabling capacity building by having them identify a minimum of one PhD and two Master's students and a junior staff member or postdoctoral fellow to support with their funding.
The UWC Research Chairs are also required to attend a national or international conference to share and engage with other institutions and build networks.
Let’s introduce you to our inaugural UWC Research Chairs and their niche area: 
Chair: Prof. Russell H Kaschula
Position: Senior Professor - Department of African Language Studies (Faculty of Arts and Humanities), UWC Research Chair in Forensic Linguistics and Multlingualism
Qualifications: BA LLB, BA (Hons), HDE, PhD (Rhodes) 
Prof. Russell H Kaschula is a Professor in the Department of African Language Studies at the University of the Western Cape and holds the newly established Institutional Chair in Forensic Linguistics and Multilingualism. For the first time in 2022 he taught an Honours course in Forensic Linguistics at the UWC and from 2023 this discipline will also be offered as part of the new Diploma in Language Practice, as well as at the MA level of study.
He has published widely in the field of Applied Language Studies, including Forensic Linguistics, Intercultural Studies and Multilingualism more generally. He has a particular interest in African Languages (isiNguni languages and isiXhosa). His more recent interests include language and crime, literary geography, as well as sociolinguistics more generally.
In 2020 he co-edited The Transformative Power of Language. From Postcolonial to Knowledge Societies in Africa, together with Prof. Ekkehard Wolff from Leipzig University (Cambridge University Press). In 2021 he published a book with Routledge in London and New York titled Languages, Identities and Intercultural Communication in South Africa and Beyond. He also co-edited A Handbook on Legal Languages and the Quest for Linguistic Equality in South Africa and Beyond, published by African SUN Press (2021), as well as co-edited a book titled Language and the Law. Global Perspectives in Forensic Linguistics from Africa and Beyond, published in 2022 (African SUN Press). He has an interest in creative writing and he has published short stories and novels in both isiXhosa and in English, one story being selected as part of the prestigious Caine Prize for African Writing, and another published as part of a book where the selection of stories was done by JM Coetzee.
Prof. Kaschula has international standing and has worked extensively with scholars in the international arena. He acts as an international advisor to the Journal of Semiotics and Law as well as a number of other journals both internationally and nationally. He is also, for example, a Board Member of Tydskrif vir Letterkunde. For many years he was the scientific editor of the Southern African Journal of African Languages and he was a board member of the African Languages of Southern Africa Association, acting as its secretary and scientific editor.
He has a B1 rating with the NRF.
The language and law research and work that Prof. Kaschula carries out links directly to the SDG 4 of creating quality education. If this is achievable through the use of appropriate language skills, then it would also lead to SDG 8, speaking to decent work and economic growth as well as no poverty. It would also contribute to peace and justice as well as strong institutions, particularly in the legal and educational workplace arenas.
Chair: Prof. Jennifer Chipps
Position: Professor - School of Nursing (Faculty of Community and Health Sciences)
Qualifications: BSc Nursing (Wits), BSc (Psychology) (Hons) (UNISA), MPH (UNSW Australia), PhD (UKZN) 
Professor Jennifer Chipps was appointed as the Faculty of Community Health Sciences Chair for Digital Health in 2022.
Jennifer Chipps is a Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of the Western Cape where she has been a faculty member since 2014 and Director of the School from 2018 to 2021. She is a NRF C2 rated researcher. 
Jennifer completed a PhD in Telemedicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and a Master’s in Public Health at the University of New South Wales, Australia. Jennifer has previously worked at the University of Sydney, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, the NSW Department of Health in Australia and the NZ Health Research Council in New Zealand. Jennifer’s research interests are Digital Health, Mental Health, Ageing, eLearning and Systematic
Reviews.
The exponential increase in the use of digital technologies, such as smartphones and AI, the impact of COVID-19, and the global aim of access and equitable health care has brought digital health to the fore as an essential new niche area in health research. Digital health technologies are essential enablers of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and underpins the vision in South Africa of ‘Better Health for all South Africans enabled by person-centred Digital Health’ (National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa 2019-2024). Digital health has a prominent place in the UWC 2035 vision statement of a “substantial place in key areas in knowledge ecosystems which aims to improve decision-making and innovation through networks, collaboration and productive relationships, and effective partnerships with universities, Africa and beyond”. In addition, it is an essential part of the Community and Health Science vision and mission of engaged and connected research within a social justice framework, aligned to the WHO objective of promoting equitable, affordable, and universal access through the development of the infrastructure for information and communication technologies for health. (WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025 & National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa 2019-2024).
Digital health research is underpinned by user-centred design principles and are co-designed projects with stakeholders with expertise in clinical health, digital technology, psychology (behaviour change) and research. Digital health technologies are not discipline-specific, requiring interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration teams including clinicians, technology developers and bioinformatics specialists.
Digital health technologies are essential enablers of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and practically all SDGs have a digital component. Specifically related to SDG3: Good Health and Well-being, new developments in wireless technologies are creating opportunities to change the health sector, solving problems of geographic access, facilitating the provision of appropriate interventions at grassroots levels, reducing intervention costs, and raising public awareness about health problems and promoting healthy lifestyles through the use of digital media, and ultimately contributing to patient empowerment
In South Africa, digital health underpins the vision in South Africa of ‘Better Health for all South Africans enabled by person-centred Digital Health’ (National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa 2019-2024). Digital health has a prominent place in the UWC 2035 vision statement of a “substantial place in key areas in knowledge ecosystems which aims to improve decision-making and innovation through networks, collaboration and productive relationships, and effective partnerships with universities, Africa and beyond”. In addition, it is an essential part of the Community and Health Science vision and mission of engaged and connected research within a social justice framework, aligned to the WHO objective of promoting equitable, affordable, and universal access through the development of the infrastructure for information and communication technologies for health. (WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025 & National Digital Health Strategy for South Africa 2019-2024).
Chair: Prof. Rajendra Chetty
Position: Professor - Department of Language Education (Faculty of Education)
Qualifications: BA (Hons), BEd (Hons), PhD(UNISA), MA (UKZN), MBA (UCT) 
Rajendra Chetty is a postcolonial scholar with transdiscplinary research interests that draw from critical theory and social movement scholarship. He leans on critical educational studies and has written on the problems of literacy in high poverty communities and the intersectionality of race, class and inequality in schooling. He is the author of eleven school language textbooks and served on national and provincial parastatal bodies concerned with the field of English studies (National English Language Body, Shakespeare Society of Southern Africa, Western Cape Language Committee, and the English Academy of Southern Africa).
His international scholarship and visiting professorships include universities in the USA, India, Brazil, Sweden, the UK, Italy and Africa. In 2015/16 he was Fulbright professor at the City University of New York (Queens College and the Graduate Centre). He served as editor of The English Academy Review: A Journal of English Studies. His alliance with civil society groups such as Equal Education, Abahlali baseMjondolo, and READ, has seen him work with activists within a participatory paradigm, drawing consistently from critical race theories.
There are three focal areas in his research programme, namely literacy; race, class and marginalisation; and postcolonial writings. All three areas are connected by post- and decolonial theoretical constructs, the key being critical theory and radical intellectualisation based on the ideas of Freire, Fanon and Biko. The project on literacy practices in poor schools in the Cape Flats is cognisant not only of the neoliberal/neo-apartheid agenda of the state, but also the influence of out-of-school issues such as poverty, violence, gangsterism and drug abuse on classroom achievement. It is evident that disciplinary knowledge may be inadequate to address complex social problems and that there should be wider societal participation in knowledge production, using a transdisciplinary lens and foregrounding voices and narratives of civil society. Apart from discernible factors for scholastic underachievement such as a lack of resources, parental support, poor teacher knowledge and a regressive curriculum, the research projects note two new areas of concern: absence of cognitive activities and social complexity of poverty.
A new model of literacy that challenges inequality and provides strategic and sustained teacher support in disadvantaged schools is crucial in the post-apartheid society. The objective of the research on out-of-school issues is that classroom achievement cannot be separated from learners’ home and community environment. The issue of educational inequality emanating from socio-economic disadvantage is a complex research area and it links with increased levels of violence and high rates of youth unemployment. An allied component of the research programme is to extend the decoloniality discourse to local struggles and subaltern positionings.
The Research Chair programme is linked to SDG 4, that states that by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes.
The key targets linked to public schooling are to: 
ensure that all children have access to quality early childhood education;
ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, human rights, gender equality, a culture of peace, global citizenship and cultural diversity; and
increase the supply of qualified teachers.
Significant progress has been made to make education accessible to poor learners through the child support grant, no-fee schools, and school nutrition programmes. This resulted in the near universal attendance of children at schools. However, opportunities to gain access to good quality education have not been equal, due to poor infrastructure and a lack of well-trained teachers in rural and township schools. In 2018, among children aged 0–6, close to 43% did not attend any education institution and 40,7% were never read to, nor told stories at home. Non-attendance of ECD education exacerbates social class differences in cognitive development among young children and impacts on future learning ability. Each year, on average, 11 out of 100 children aged 14–17 repeated grades. Around 100 000 children aged 6–13 were out-of-school and the most affected were coloured children in the North West and Western Cape. An indicator of the rising levels of poverty in the country is that 83% of children participate in school feeding schemes.
Chair: Prof. Marieta du Plessis
Position: Associate Professor - Department of Industrial Psychology (Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences), UWC Research Chair in Leadership in Higher Education
Qualifications: BA, BA (Hons), MA (Human Resource Management) (SU), PhD (Industrial Psychology) (UWC), Registered Industrial Psychologist (HPCSA) 
Prof. Marieta du Plessis is a Registered Industrial Psychologist with more than ten years of consulting and educational experience. With a passion for helping individuals, teams and businesses grow, she has dedicated her time to creating healthy Human Resource practices in organisations and facilitated numerous hours of individual discussions with clients to assist them in reaching their next level of success. 
Her specific areas of teaching and research are Organisational Behaviour and Psychology, Leadership, Positive Organisational Scholarship and Occupational Counselling. She has also successfully supervised six Master's dissertations in Industrial Psychology.
In 2014, Prof. Du Plessis was awarded a Thuthuka research grant by the National Research Foundation of South Africa for the completion of her PhD. Masters in Human Resource Management (Stellenbosch University) - The relationship between servant leadership, emotional intelligence, trust in the immediate supervisor and meaning in life: An exploratory study Supervisor: Dr Z Dannhauser.
She is an NRF Y-rated Researcher.
Chair: Prof. Gregory Ruiters
Position: Professor - School of Government (Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences) 
Qualifications: PhD (Johns Hopkins University); MA (Cum Laude) (University of Witwatersrand); BA Hons (University of Witwatersrand); BA (UCT) 
Professor Ruiters has been a professor at the UWC School of Government since 2011 where he teaches and supervises a dozen or more post graduate students. His academic and scholarly interests span a range of socio political issues at the intersection of social justice, political movements, the environment and the local state.
The creation of a new research chair under the niche area of democracy and citizenship will position the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences (EMS) at the forefront of teaching, research, and knowledge on democracy, and provide opportunities for Doctoral and Masters’ students to develop their research interests in the broad area of democracy and citizenship and related sub-themes. The chair position will galvanise thought leadership on key issues regarding democracy and citizenship and will initiate and lead the development of new curricula in the research focus areas. The chair will also host public panels in partnership with other stakeholders, institutions and community groups focused on citizen engagement and related themes.
The most recent (2022) World Inequality Report notes: “The poorest half of the global population barely owns any wealth at all, possessing just 2% of the total. In contrast, the richest 10% of the global population own 76% of all wealth” The authors insist that “inequality is not inevitable, it is a political choice. In this context democracy in the sense of people taking control of their collective destinies remains a powerful idea, despite the fact that there are many different and sometimes contradictory beliefs about democracy and the role of institutions in developing democratic citizenship and the common good.
The rationale of this research chair is to assist in rethinking and re-envisaging democracy within our own context and in various sites (home, school, workplace and city) as praxis in everyday transformative processes. We also want to encourage investigations of the preconditions for transcending procedural democracy and building substantive democracy, informed by South Africa’s discrete spatial, infrastructural and housing inequalities such as we see in the township versus suburb divide (see Friedman, 2015). The project will encourage theorising social differences and politics of recognition and redistribution (incorporating issues such as non-racialism, provincialism, the black township and group identity in SA). The specific issues regarding the quality of elections, electoral systems, party funding and internal life of our political parties, state accountability, corruption, state capacity and social movements will also need to be looked at.
SDG 11 speaks to the goals of making “cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. The Chair seeks to promote transparency and relevant knowledge to deepen public-minded civicness, promote spatial justice and social solidarity across class, gender and racial divides. It seeks to improve local citizenship and belonging for especially the excluded majority, youth and women on a city-wide basis rather than a parochial focus.
SDG 16 seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The Chair and its activities will contribute to strengthening this goal with a focus on democratic institutions, ecological justice, decommodification and citizen centred public administration reform.
Chair: Prof. Yonatan T. Fessha
Position: Professor - Department of Public Law and Jurisprudence (Faculty of Law)
Qualifications: PhD (University of the Western Cape), LLM (University of Pretoria, LLB, Faculty of Law, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, Diploma in ‘Federalism, constitutionalism and democratic governance in multicultural societies’, The Institute of Federalism, University of Fribourg, Switzerland 
Yonatan T. Fessha is Professor of Law and Research Chair in constitutional design in divided societies at the University of the Western Cape.
His teaching and research focus on examining the relevance of constitutional design in dealing with the challenges of divided societies. He has published widely on matters pertaining to, but not limited to, federalism, constitutional design, autonomy, intergovernmental relations and politicised ethnicity. His publications include books on “Intergovernmental relations in divided societies” (Palgrave 2022, co-edited), ‘Courts and federalism in Africa: Design and impact in comparative perspective’ (Routledge 2020, co-edited) and “Ethnic diversity and federalism: Constitution making in South Africa and Ethiopia” (Ashgate 2010). He was a Michigan Grotius Research Scholar and recipient of the Marie-Curie fellowship.
The chair focuses on constitutional design in divided societies, investigating the relevance and effectiveness of constitutional design in the management of divided societies, societies that are grappling with identity-based political tensions and conflicts. The Chair focuses on the priorities set by the Sustainable Development Goals. The imperatives of establishing and maintaining peaceful and inclusive societies has been recognised as a priority area in the Sustainable Development Goals.
Goal 16 of SDG calls for the promotion of ‘peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development’, the provision of ‘access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels’.
Chair: Prof. David Holgate
Position: Professor - Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Faculty of Natural Sciences)
Qualifications: BSc (Hons) (UCT), MSc (UCT), PhD (UCT) 
David Holgate is a senior professor of Mathematics. Before being awarded the research chair in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, he served as Head of Department and as Deputy Dean responsible for Teaching and Learning in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. He is passionate about sharing his love for pure mathematics through research, teaching and academic service in the context of South Africa, because he believes that Mathematics has a truly powerful role to play in nation building and addressing social injustice.
David’s research niche is in the overlap of Topology and Category Theory. Topology is a large branch of mathematics that studies continuity of movement, shape and time, and the structures that allow you to work with these. Category theory is a unifying theory that seeks to understand mathematical objects and structures by asking how they relate to other things. (Typically, mathematicians express their ideas by using the language of set theory, in which mathematical objects are understood by what belongs to them.) His research approaches topology from the philosophical standpoint of understanding mathematics by how structures relate to each other, how they interact. How does working in topology help to develop category theory and how does using the insights of category theory deepen our understanding of topology?
Besides his research interest in Topology and Category Theory, for which he holds a B-rating from the South African NRF, David also contributes to research in (undergraduate) mathematics education and academic staff development. He maintains a broad involvement in national mathematics activities, playing a key role in the National Graduate Academy for Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, a consortium of South African universities that collaborate regarding the training of the next generation of mathematicians, statisticians and data scientists. He is currently on the Council of the South African Mathematical Society (SAMS), the board of the South African Mathematics Foundation (SAMF) and chairs the Council of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).
Before joining the UWC David held positions at the University of Cape Town, where he completed his PhD in 1995, and the University of Stellenbosch, where he headed the Mathematics Division of their Department of Mathematical Sciences for a while. Over the course of his academic career he has been a research guest at over 20 universities across the globe and held visiting positions at the University of Bremen (Germany) and the Brno University of Technology (Czech Republic).
David makes sure that mathematics does not take all his time away from his life’s main passions – his family and the fynbos, mountains and oceans of the Western Cape.
As a fundamental science, Mathematics underpins the advancement required to attain many of the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals. Indeed, UNESCO declared July 2022 to June 2023 to be the “International Year of Basic Sciences in Sustainable Development” (IYBSSD2022), highlighting the essential contribution that the basic sciences have to make in the implementation of the SDGs. In making this declaration UNESCO explains that while “basic sciences are the sine qua non for sustainable development” their role is not always appreciated.
In pursuing his research David is directly motivated by his contribution to Quality Education (SDG-4) and the breaking down of traditional barriers that have excluded many from Mathematics and weakened the subject as a result (SDGs 5, 10 and 17 in particular). It is easy to overlook the contributions of abstract, basic sciences that are driven more by curiosity than application. However, innovation and the creativity required to overcome societal challenges requires a foundation that sets a tone of collaboration, creativity and interdisciplinary awareness. This is the mathematical environment that David’s research group aims to provide.
Chair: Prof. Barry Andrews
Position: Head of Department - Department of Sport, Recreation and Exercise Science (Faculty of Community and Health Sciences), UWC Research Chair in High Performance Sport
Qualifications: BSc (Sport Science), BSc (Hons) (Sport Science), MSc (Sport Science) (Cum Laude), PhD (SU) 
Prof. Andrews is the project leader for the HDI funded High Performance Sport Project; Head of Department of the Sport, Recreation and Exercise Science; and was appointed as the UWC Research Chair for High Performance Sport at the University of the Western Cape in Cape Town.
Prof. Andrews believes that Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide an important framework for organisations using sport to focus their work on. His niche research area is in High-Performance Sport and maximising the sporting potential of persons with disabilities, and he has written numerous articles in these fields. He has served as a visiting professor at Leuven University, Belgium and has given numerous lectures at several foreign partner universities. He indicates that it is really an exciting time as it is rare that people hear about any sort of high-performance directive or niche area or movement towards getting their athletes and sporting codes to move in a high-performance manner. At the UWC: Sport has been identified as a vehicle not only for professional sports athletes, but also recreational and his main goal is to build on the High-Performance legacy.
As part of the HDI funding he has been able to contribute to seeing the university build a high-performance gym on campus by the stadium. The niche area has brought in a host of health professional services linked to sport to work with our athletes and these included physiotherapy, biokinetics, a sports physician as well as strength conditioning experts and a dietician. One of the key successes of the approach used within the high-performance sports project is the multidisciplinary team, which is the way they need to start operating in the world nowadays.
The Research Chair for Sport will allow for further development in the high-performance sport niche especially, building upon work done from the HDI High Performance project. Specifically, linking the SDGs, it will add to quality education SDG 4 with the development of the higher certificate in high-performance sport and recreation; aid in sustainability SDG 11 of high-performance on campus by developing a sustainable model built on research and partnerships both within UWC and from external partners; and these partnerships SDG 17 will aid to create a multi-disciplinary centre of sport and specifically in high-performance sport to facilitate the best performances from our athletes and teams thereby helping build the university name.
Chair: Prof. Manogari Chetty
Position: Head of Department - Department of Craniofacial Biology, Pathology & Radiology (Faculty of Dentistry), UWC Research Chair iin Oral Health
Qualifications: BSc (UKZN), BChD, MChD (UWC), PhD (UCT) 
Prof. Chetty is a full Professor and a board certified Oral and Maxillofacial Pathologist in the Faculty of Dentistry. She is recognised nationally and internationally in the fields of Dental (Craniofacial) Genetics, and Non-communicable diseases, in particular rare diseases which manifest in the head and neck.
Prof. Chetty sees this opportunity of being the research chair as a way to afford oral health practitioners the opportunity to actually do research in fields that are generally quite limited in terms of funds. Having been introduced to the world of Human Genetics in 2012, several research projects within the field of genetics and molecular dentistry were initiated. This is the branch of dentistry that focuses on the effects that inherited genetic variation among individuals has on both risk of developing rare (e.g. orofacial clefting) and common (caries, periodontitis and head and neck cancer) dental diseases and disorders. Just as physicians envision a future of “personalised medicine” where the “one size fits all” model of diagnosis and treatment are a thing of the past; this same strategy is also emerging as the new field of “personalised dentistry.”
She believes that there is an urgent need for those involved in oral health research to participate in translational clinical research that will accelerate targeted scientific breakthroughs in the management of oral diseases in Africa, and will be addressed. To achieve this objective, further research will focus on genetic, genomic and molecular investigations into non-communicable oral health conditions such as oral cancer, periodontitis and rare diseases with craniofacial manifestations and dental management implications. Research capacity development is another focus of the proposed project.
Prof. Chetty is proposing to train dental clinicians to have expertise in various niche areas such as clinical human genetics, laboratory sciences- particularly molecular biology, teaching and learning, and research methods. These dentist-scientists will be the pioneers in the field in South Africa and will be responsible for training future undergraduate and postgraduate students.
Her work addresses SDGs 3, 4, and 10. SDG 3: Good Health and well-being, enhanced translational clinical research that will accelerate targeted scientific breakthroughs and result in the improved management of patients with oral diseases in Africa. SDG 4: Quality Education, this project will be the catalyst of transdisciplinary, collaborative, and translational oral health science research, training and innovation. SDG 10: Reduced inequalities (reduce inequality within and among countries). Translational oral health research in Africa for Africans. Reduce our overdependence on findings from technologically advanced countries.
Chair: Prof. Trevor Moodley
Position: Associate Professor - Department of Educational Psychology (Faculty of Education), UWC Research Chair in Early Childhood Development
Qualifications: HDE (Springfield College of Education), BSc (UNISA), BPhil (SU), BEd (Hons) (UWC), MEd (SU), PhD (UFS), Registered Educational Psychologist 
Prof. Moodley is an Associate Professor in the Educational Psychology Department, Faculty of Education.
He has been in education since the beginning of 1988. He previously spent 21 years in basic education and then transitioned into the higher education sector as an academic. He has gained invaluable experience across the education sector and has a keen sense of the lived experiences of teachers, learners, parents and communities which has served him well in his university role as a teacher educator and scholar.
His passion for teaching and his professional expertise as an educational psychologist has always prompted an interest in the factors that influence teaching and learning, as well as ways to enhance teaching and learning. He is an ardent promoter of holistic education that develops whole beings from a young age.
He is keenly aware of the importance of Early Childhood Development (ECD) in setting the foundations for so many different life outcomes that have enormous impact on individual and societal life experiences. These interests are reflected in his academic outputs in the form of research projects, conference presentations, journal articles, book chapters and completed supervisions of postgraduate studies.
He is currently developing an early childhood development higher certificate qualification which focuses on preparing teachers to work in early childhood care and education centres (also known as ECD centres) with babies, toddlers and young children from birth to four years of age. This qualification will contribute towards the professionalisation of the early childhood education sector, prior to formal schooling; which is sorely needed in the country. An ECD focus is especially important in South Africa, given our many challenges which are often rooted in the early learning and development experiences of young South African children.
The Faculty of Education is the appropriate research context to set and expand a research footprint in ECD, since the primary role of the Faculty is to provide professional training for preservice teachers and extend knowledge in education through post-graduate course offerings and research in the field of education.
The Research Chair in ECD offers the opportunity to consolidate and extend scholarship in the field of ECD within the Faculty of Education and with external partners in higher education and the non-governmental organisation sectors. This scholarly endeavour speaks mainly to SDG 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all, which includes as one of its targets, access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education. Since the quality of ECD is a good predictor of other life outcomes, this Research Chair niche also speaks to other SDGs such as the eradication of poverty SDG 1, ending hunger and improving nutrition SDG 3, achieving gender equality SDG 5, and reducing inequality within and across countries to improve decent work and economic growth SDG 8. He sees this as an honourable opportunity, which will allow him to focus on ECD as both a teaching, research and scholarship niche.
Chair: Prof. Chux Gervase Iwu
Position: Professor - Department of Management and Entrepreneurship (Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences), UWC Research Chair in Entrepreneurship in Higher Education
Qualifications: DTech (CPUT), MSc (Ibadan Nigeria), BLS (Hons) (IMOSU Nigeria), ADM (UWC) 
Prof. Iwu is a Professor in Entrepreneurship Management at the University of the Western Cape. He has a multidisciplinary background that encompasses degrees in Library Studies, Industrial and Organisational Psychology, Human Resources Management, and an advanced diploma in Management.
Prof. Iwu researches the broad area of socio-economic issues in emerging economies. A common socio-economic problem in Africa is graduate unemployment. South Africa struggles with that as well, resulting in the need for students to become economically active during and after their studies and subsequently pursue self-employment instead of paid employment. The university is an integral part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Entrepreneurship development in South Africa’s higher education is, therefore, a crucial agenda.
South Africa’s National Development Plan (2030) makes a fervent call for the reduction of poverty and inequality and further advises that to achieve those, there is a need to broaden opportunity and employment through economic inclusion, education, and skills, and thereby promoting mutual respect and inclusiveness as enshrined in the constitution. A further justification is drawn from the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, which hopes to achieve broad-based, and sustainable economic growth by promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship and consequently job creation. The goal of the Chair is to realise productive entrepreneurship through research that leads to accelerated interest in entrepreneurship among students.
Reaching a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students, faculty, and the wider university community is linked to the university’s mission and goals, which promote entrepreneurial teaching, research, and community engagement. In achieving this goal, entrepreneurship research should uncover elements that support entrepreneurial uptake, and how these elements are embeddable in the curricula of business and non-business-related programs in South African institutions of higher learning.
While this niche area can find a home in any of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is closely associated with goals #1 (No Poverty), #4 (Quality Education), #8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and #10 (Reduced Inequalities). The UN considers quality education and sustainable economic growth crucial for developing economies’ advancement. The essence of quality education is that it broadens one’s chances of attaining decent work opportunities which in turn advance the economic growth of a nation.
There is a link between joblessness, inequality, and poverty in South Africa. The latest figures for unemployment in South Africa depict the dismal struggle to curb the triple threat of poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Entrepreneurs have played important roles in reducing poverty, inequality, and unemployment. The outcome of entrepreneurial initiatives is found in small, medium, and micro businesses and so over the years, small, medium, and micro businesses have gained fame as noteworthy contributors to the economy of any nation.
Chair: Prof. Karin van Marle
Position: Professor - Department of Public Law and Jurisprudence (Faculty of Law), UWC Research Chair in Gender Transformation and World-making
Qualifications: BLC LLB (UP), LLM (Cum Laude), LLD (Unisa), Advocate of the High Court of SA 
Prof. Van Marle is a Professor in the Department of Public Law and Jurisprudence at the University of the Western Cape.
Prof. Van Marle has taught Jurisprudence on undergraduate level for 27 years, as well as electives and masters modules in Critical Legal Theory, Feminist Theory, Law and aesthetics and related fields. Her research falls within the broad field of law and the humanities and involves critical theory, legal philosophy and jurisprudence. Her work on post-1994 jurisprudence engages with the crisis of modernity and a rethinking of law and legal theory along the lines of fragility, finitude and a ‘giving up of certitudes’. She is an ethical feminist, and her research and writing are inspired by and embedded in feminist theory. Her research focus and projects over many years have been on the question of transformation and co-habitance/living together. She is in particular concerned with the possibilities of 7 transforming society in a way that could live up to the ideals of freedom, equality, dignity, social justice and democracy for all, with an emphasis on gendered lives.
As Research Chair in Gender, Transformation and World-making she aims to engage in depth with the question of the extent to which the structural and everyday challenges of gendered lives have changed, if at all. Transformation will be taken as a framework through which to investigate the past and present position of gender as well as an aspirational framework of possible futures and the making of gendered worlds.
The research chair in Gender, Transformation and World-making links with sustainable development goals through Prof. Van Marle’s focus on gender and transformation, which speaks directly to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The vision driving her research includes the aspiration for ‘[a] world in which every woman and girl enjoys full gender equality and all legal, social and economic barriers to their empowerment.
Prof. Van Marle will draw on various theories to reflect on, and respond to the description of the world today with regards to the discussion around SDG's. Section 20 of the vision speaks directly to gender equality and the extent to which ‘full human potential and sustainable development is not possible if one half of humanity continues to be denied its full human rights and opportunities.’ Equal access to quality education, economic resources, political participation, employment, leadership and decision-making, increase in investment and support for institutions relating to gender equality, and the empowerment of women are envisioned. All forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls should be eliminated. The SDG Goal 5 and Goal 11 relate directly to the project. Goal 5 speaks directly to gender equality and empowerment and Goal 11 which refers to cities and human settlements being made inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.
Prof. Van Marle would like her work to contribute to society and to serve the community, and believes in the high value and capacity of conceptual works (thinking and theory) to make a change with slow reflection and recognition for her work as an active researcher. She aims to complete a scholarly monograph, an edited collection and a special issue of a journal. Each of these publications will be linked to one of the three main themes of the project. She sees the university as a public space and hopes that the chair can contribute to a revival of the idea of the university - as a space of contestation and active dialogue, opening up the conversation to plural worlds.
Chair: Prof. Ndomelele Ndiko Ludidi
Position: Professor - Department of Biotechnology (Faculty of Natural Sciences), UWC Research Chair in Sustainable Agriculture
Qualifications: PhD (UWC) 
Prof. Ludidi is a Professor of Biotechnology at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa. He is an established researcher (NRF rating of C2) with expertise in plant molecular biology, plant physiology and biochemistry. He has extensive university-level teaching experience in biochemistry, plant biotechnology and plant physiology.
His research interests are in plant- environment interactions, with focus on abiotic and biotic stress in crop plants. The abiotic aspects of his research relate to physiological and molecular effects of drought, heat and salinity stress on plants. The biotic aspects of his research concern the influence of microbial diversity on crops tolerance to the aforementioned abiotic stresses. He explores plant-environment interactions which encompasses the effects of cropping systems on soil health and the interaction between plants and insects. He merges these diverse fields of study towards establishment of climate-smart regenerative agriculture systems to produce climate change resilient crops and develop crop production systems that promote environmental sustainability in agriculture and ensure food security. He uses his expertise in research and teaching within the plant science discipline and contributes to community agricultural development that impacts food security positively.
Sustaining soil health through optimised plant cropping systems, regenerative agriculture, and agro-ecologically sound principles, coupled with the associated improvement in plant crop yield, ensures that sufficient and high-quality crop-based human food and animal feed is produced, which contributes towards achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). The regenerative agricultural and genetic approaches used in his research ensure that crop production can be done in an environmentally sound approach that reduces the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing agricultural adaptation to climate change, which is crucial to SDG 13 (Climate Action). Prof. Ludidi is actively involved in teaching at undergraduate and postgraduate level, in which he keeps abreast of the latest developments in his academic discipline to ensure that he delivers a high-quality learning experience for his students, thus striving for attainment of SDG 4 (Quality Education).
His expectation is that, through being the change in sustainable agriculture, everyone would be able to train more students in sustainable agriculture practices, develop programs and modules that really entrench sustainable culture as part of the university offering from an academic point of view. He is expecting this to be one of the major achievements, besides postgraduate student collaborations in publications. Publications can be seen in three ways. Firstly, publishing through writing books or chapters in books, and peer-reviewed journals, and really also international and national presentations or key note addresses conferences now. What the Chair anticipates, is mainly concerned with a greater number of students getting trained in sustainable agriculture, but also an increase in publications that are related to sustainable culture coming from our tendency. Also creating an impact at the policy level, in order to change the way our culture is practiced, nationally. And I'm hoping that that achievement would then have a trickling effect towards community impact, where the work we do is not seen only as academic, but really applied research that has an impact on food security and environmental sustainability.

There are few opportunities for girls younger than 10 to participate in competitive soccer. Those who are interested in the game have to play with and against boys. This hampers the grassroots development of the women’s game in a country where Banyana Banyana already participated in their first FIFA World Cup and have recently won the Women’s African Cup of Nations (WAFCON). 
To address the gap, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) has launched She-Bobo at UWC – a soccer league established exclusively for girls under-8 and under-10.
Dr Danny Jordaan, South African Football Association president and UWC alumnus, says the league’s launch could not have come at a better time.
“It is a project that we are certainly delighted about and will support. It’s in the context of us making a bid for the Women’s World Cup in 2027. We are going to launch our intention to bid and then a full bidding process will be outlined by FIFA … around the time that we will see the launch of She-Bobo. It is indeed a wonderful initiative,” he said.
“UWC has made its contribution. More than 15 of our national team players come from UWC – both in terms of sport and education. Many of them are graduates and it’s no wonder that 80 percent of the Banyana team are graduates. It is something we encourage. We hope these girls that start at an early age will eventually enrol at the University to continue their studies. This is one of the most important things: sport and education, and not a choice between a sporting career and having an education.”
Professor Tyrone Pretorius, UWC Rector and Vice-Chancellor and himself a notable soccer alumnus, said: “It is our hope that She-Bobo becomes the blueprint for how universities around the country can engage communities through sport and become the drivers for social change as the anchor institutions in our society. 
“As we celebrate our heroes as the WAFCON champions, we welcome the new cohort of future stars gracing our sporting fields in the She-Bobo at UWC league. We will be watching with great interest the progress of these little superstars, from goals to graduation gowns.”
She-Bobo at UWC will include soccer clubs in neighbouring communities and across the metropole to play in a league of their own in 2023. On 22 October 2022, UWC Stadium hosted a football festival - as a taste of what is to come - where girl footballers from 12 clubs participated in a day of soccer fun. 
The league is the brainchild of UWC Media and Marketing manager, Gasant Abarder – off the back of the University already being a hub for women’s football. 
UWC is home to a senior women’s football side that finished 3rd in the Hollywoodbets-sponsored national football league in 2021 and won the prestigious 2021 Varsity Women's Football tournament in the same year. Our alumnae include Thembi Kgatlana, a former African Women’s Footballer of the Year, who played European Champions League football and who scored South Africa’s first ever goal in a women’s World Cup.
The University’s modern facilities and playing fields will play host to She-Bobo at UWC. Our UWC Stadium playing surface is PSL-approved. But more than our impressive facilities, we will expose the girl footballers to our academic disciplines in higher education where in many communities attending a university is not an option. Their families will become accustomed to university life long before they enter the doors of learning as students.
The University will provide playing kit and equipment, facilities, security, infrastructure, coaching workshops, referees, transport, meals and refreshments. 
“We believe that creating a platform for junior girl footballers is an investment in young girl children. We want to be a game changer as a catalyst for social change and a conduit to the girl child realising her full potential – from excelling on the playing field to eventually graduating from UWC as a well-rounded citizen of the world. At UWC, we know full well how talented girl footballers are in a league of their own. We want to be their springboard for a whole new world that connects possibilities,” said Abarder. 
WATCH: Dr Danny Jordaan’s full interview on She-Bobo here. 
On 22 October 2022, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) hosted the She-Bobo at UWC football festival for under-8 and under-10 girls as a showcase of the inaugural league next year.
The league is fully endorsed by South African Football Association (SAFA) President Danny Jordaan as well as former Manchester United and Bafana Bafana star, Quinton Fortune. 
She-Bobo at UWC seeks to address the lack of competitive soccer for girls under the age of 10 in the Cape Metropole. The university is already a significant contributor to the women’s game, with half of the Women’s African Cup of Nations winners for Banyana Banyana being either current students or alumnae. 
The following community clubs participated in the fun football festival to introduce the junior girls’ league:
Under-8
Salt River Blackpool FC
Mighty City (late addition for Hellenic FC)
Cape Town Roses FC
RV United FC
Matroosfontein FC
Heideveld Female Football Academy
Camps Bay FC
Cape Flats Sports Academy
Blikkiesdorp FC
Ikasi Soccer School 
Under-10
Salt River Blackpool FC
Mighty City (late addition for Hellenic FC)
Cape Town Roses FC
RV United FC
Matroosfontein FC
Bellville City FC
Heideveld Female Football Academy
Camps Bay FC
Tramway FC
Cape Flats Sports Academy
The UWC Stadium will be the place to be on Saturday, 22 October 2022. Come and cheer on our girls as we see them play In a League of Their Own. There will be food trucks, entertainment and giveaways. Entry will be free.
She-Bobo at UWC team coaches participated in the Premier Skills programme on 20 and 21 October 2022. 
The Premier Skills programme is an initiative between the British Council South Africa and the English Premier League. The British Council is the United Kingdom's international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities.
This junior league for girls will create a platform for talent to shine on the soccer field, but is also an opportunity for their coaches to learn new skills.
The teams come from diverse communities across the Cape Town Metropole.

This is all about levelling the playing field, and the coaches were eager to learn more about how they can upskill the girls, and along the way, hone their own skills.
Errol van der Byl is the coach of Blikkiesdorp United FC, which has 150 junior players in various teams.
“This programme means a lot to me because I am always experiencing different challenges with coaching,” said Van Der Byl.
“I am always keen to gain more experience and learn new skills because you work with children from different backgrounds every day.”
Azeezah Gool from Hanover Park is a coach for the Cape Flats Sports Academy. She has just started her coaching career and is keen to learn as much as she can.
“I am learning so much about how to work with the kids, and we just needed this experience from this programme, and it's helping us a lot,” said Gool.
Shannon Mills, a coach at Salt River Blackpool FC, said: “I have been on a coaching course before… but there is always more to learn”.
“This course, presented by Premier Skills, is a bit different from the regular courses offered by the SAFA facilitators, so I was very keen to see their take on grassroots and junior football,” she added.

The School of Natural Medicine (SoNM) is dedicated to the education and training of professionals in various disciplines of complementary health sciences, as well as research within this field. Specifically, SoNM represents the professional disciplines of Acupuncture, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy, and Unani-Tibb, which are recognised within the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) under the Department of Health. These disciplines fall under the broader umbrella of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Traditional Medicine (TM), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cochrane Collaboration.
Natural Medicine and Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Context:
Natural medicine encompasses diverse healthcare systems that enhance the body's natural healing capacity, with or without synthetic pharmaceuticals. CAM is broadly defined as treatments that exist outside mainstream conventional medicine, encompassing a wide range of health systems, modalities, and practices based on different cultural and historical contexts. TM, as per the WHO, includes the knowledge, skills, and practices indigenous to different cultures, used for maintaining health, preventing illness, and treating physical and mental conditions. CAM and TM incorporate various treatment modalities, including nutritional medicine, lifestyle interventions, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, homoeopathy, massage therapy, energy medicine (e.g., Reiki), and mind-body techniques (e.g., meditation and yoga). 
Role of Natural Medicine in Health and Wellness Sector
Natural Medicine has a significant role in promoting health, preventing illness, and managing disease through holistic, patient-centred approaches, conventional medical knowledge and traditional knowledge systems. Patient management would be diverse between professions and based on the relevant Scope of Practice as outlined by AHPCSA. The contributions of natural medicine to healthcare are diverse and vary based on cultural, historical, and scientific perspectives. Natural medicine has numerous benefits, including preventative healthcare, integrative approaches to chronic disease and rehabilitation, expanding public access to healthcare, supporting integrative treatments with conventional medicine, promoting personalised patient-centred care, alongside contributions to regulation and professional development. 
Regulation and Professional Recognition in South Africa
Under the Allied Health Professions Act (Act 63 of 1984), the AHPCSA (regulated under the Department of Health) is responsible for regulating various CAM and TM professions in South Africa. These include Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Phytotherapy, Therapeutic Aromatherapy, Therapeutic Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Reflexology and Unani-Tibb. These professions represent a unique and protected niche within South Africa’s healthcare landscape. However, despite the legal recognition of these disciplines, there are limited training programs in South Africa that contribute to the education and professional registration of complementary health science practitioners.
The Role of the School of Natural Medicine
The University of the Western Cape is one of the few institutions in South Africa dedicated to the education, research, and professional development of practitioners in complementary health sciences. The SoNM plays a central role in integrating health science knowledge, traditional healing systems, holistic patient care, sustainability, and evidence-based practice, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for clinical practice, policy development, and research at regional, national, and global levels.
Future Programmes at the School of Natural Medicine
The SoNM is currently undergoing a curriculum re-structuring process, with future programs pending approval. Planned developments include the introduction of a Professional Bachelor’s degree, Master of Science degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas, and PhD programs. These new qualifications aim to enhance the academic and professional pathways for natural medicine practitioners while aligning with the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. Further information on these programs will be made available following the necessary institutional, statutory body, and government accreditations."

About UWC's Gender Equity Unit
The Gender Equity Unit’s activities and programmes are geared towards making sure that no one is discriminated against, harassed or hurt because of their gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation, and to facilitating the empowerment of particularly women and other marginalised groups, both on campus and within society at large.​ 
Our Mission
The Gender Equity Unit promotes Women and Gender equity and social justice through feminist research, education and advocacy in the University of the Western Cape and beyond. 
Our Vision
The leading Gender Equity Unit recognised for its feminist intellectual activism and capacitating societies towards ensuring equity in all spheres of life. 
Our Aims
1) Ensure Women’s and Gender equity in all spheres of life
2) Promote social justice and human rights
3) Enhance the students’ experience to facilitate successfully through raising awareness and education
4) Equipping the University of the Western Cape community and broader communities to become informed, conscious, and active citizens with regard to Women and Gender issues
5) Conduct relevant research to advance the thought leadership and influence 
Our History
Women and Gender concerns at the University of the Western Cape were addressed within a very specific context. In the mid-1980s, when the country was still embroiled in the liberation struggle, women and gender issues were of lesser concern than the bigger issue of human rights. However, a small group of feminists – and men supporting feminism – at the university were deeply concerned about the structural inequities that existed between women and men on campus and set about advocating change. ​
These inequities included disparities in salaries between women and men; men generally earned more than women; women did not receive housing subsidies; there was no maternity leave for women; there were no promotion opportunities for women; women could not go on sabbaticals and all the professors were male with white men in the most senior professorships.
Feminists were concerned about the lack of substantive equity. Issues with regard to bodily integrity, reproductive health and safety and security were of the first items on the transformative agenda for women on campus. As one woman lecturer commented: 'I practically gave birth in the classroom.' During the mid-eighties the then Rector, Jakes Gerwel, was approached by women staff to address their equity concerns. Subsequently a Women's Commission was formed in the late eighties that drew up a list of discriminatory practices, proposals to address them and submitted it to the Rector, Senate and Council.
The list included issues around maternity benefits, housing subsidy, childcare facilities, a sexual harassment policy and the safety for women on campus. Systematically public presentations were made and gains were achieved. The university management was compelled to become more supportive and gender-sensitive in their dealings with women. Women's concerns became part of the broad political social transformative discourse at the university.
In 1993, the Gender Equity Unit was formally established and the first Gender Equity Coordinator, Rhoda Kadalie, was appointed. The Unit was established with seed funding from the Ford Foundation. It was realised that the broader national liberation movement under the auspices of the Mass Democratic Movement did not include the liberation of women. The denial of women's liberation was acutely felt on campus as many of these activist organizations were based at the University of the Western Cape during the height of apartheid. Many of the women on campus were also involved in United Women's Congress; the African National Congress Women's League and the United Democratic Front. There was therefore a keen political awareness of the marginalization of women's concerns. The university is well known as a site of struggle against the apartheid regime.
Women students on campus were also particularly aware of the oppression of women. Collette Solomons, an anthropology honours student, submitted a mini thesis: 'Sexism at the University of the Western Cape: with reference to progressive student organizations'. This thesis evoked strong debates because it focused on issues of rape and harassment amongst the student population on campus and it challenged the notion of justice and respect for women students.
Women students demanded that gender justice be included in the quest for democracy in the students' struggle for freedom.
The pressure for the university to become inclusive of women's rights as human rights came from both the students and staff. The Gender Equity Unit staff started to hold countless public debates, forced the student disciplinary committees to change, conducted awareness raising workshops, educated and trained student leadership and hosted extensive conscientising programmes in the residences to transform the gender hostile climate on campus.
By the mid-nineties the University of the Western Cape had the best maternity benefits in the country, five months fully-paid leave and seven days paternity leave for men; housing subsidies for married women; chief invigilation duties for women; and an educare centre for children of staff. The unit also developed a Sexual Harassment Policy; a Gender Policy and a Non-Sexist Language Policy. Resource booklets on sexual harassment were developed and distributed. Ad hominem promotion was granted to women academics, and they for the first time had equitable access to study leave and research funding. A Women's and Gender Studies Programme was also established.
Women students formed a volunteer group, called Kopanang and began to raise gender awareness amongst students. UWC became the centre for women and gender awareness raising in the country well in advance of the post-apartheid liberal language framework and rhetoric. 
Programmes
Food Programme
The Gender Equity Unit’s Food Programme seek to encourage both students and staff to be generous and provide non-perishable food items that are redistributed to students who fall completely through the safety net. These are students who often are not eligible for NSFAS and who is not a recipient of a bursary or scholarship and does not receive any financial support from other sources such as family. 
HumaNature
HumaNature is a programme that raises awareness on campus around matters affecting people who are differently-abled. The programme promotes awareness by providing students and staff access to South African Sign Language Classes, exposing students and staff to the lived realities of people who are differently-abled by frequent visits to non-governmental and community-based organisations advancing their interests and attending an annual breakfast in the dark as hosted by Cape Town Society for the Blind. 
Imbewu
Imbewu is a student-run newsletter that encourages students to write critically about their experiences and surroundings on campus. The newsletter publishes various writings including poetry, personal reflections, reviews and critical pieces. It always seeks to provide alternative narratives to the dominant narratives undermining the politics of the marginalised.

Loud Enuf
LoudEnuf is a programme that provides social support and a safe space for LGBTIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer/Questioning) students in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders. Since 2007, the programme has hosted bi-annual awareness raising and advocacy months in May (International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia: 17 May) and October (National Month for LGBTIQ awareness). The awareness raising and advocacy consist of facilitated film screenings, workshops, seminars, marches, fun runs, student centre performances, generosity drives etc. 
Mentoring
Through the Mentoring Programme student volunteers spend time with school learners in the surrounding communities of UWC. Students offer friendship, guidance and social and academic support to learners who often view them as positive role models. The student-mentors and learner-mentees retreat to an annual camp through which they get an opportunity to bond with one another and foster a relationship of trust and comradery. 
Edu-Drama
Edu-Drama is an interactive theatre and dram a programme. The programme consists of six productions that have all been performed at the National Arts Festival and various theatres, tertiary institutions, government departments, conferences and Arts Festivals since 2008.

Afrikaans is a national asset and the fact that most of the community of Afrikaans speakers reside in the Western Cape is a huge advantage. Afrikaans is an important source of knowledge and empowerment. That is why our department is home to all varieties of Afrikaans.
We want all speakers of Afrikaans to share once again in the creation and enjoyment of literature and the development of the language as an intellectual instrument. With our special courses, we also open the doors widely to non-Afrikaans-speakers.

BACKGROUND
The Centre for the Performing Arts (CPA) was opened in 2005 by the now retired Rector and Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Brian O’Connell and the late Emeritus Prof. Nicholas Basson. Both were instrumental in opening the CPA as a performance space for UWC.
The process of creating the CPA and acquiring a venue took place four years after the closure of the UWC Music Department (under the Arts Faculty), as a result of the severe financial constraints UWC suffered in 2001.
The late Emeritus Prof. Nicholas Basson was the first director at the UWC Centre for the Performing Arts, a unit under the Rector’s Office or Rectorate.
Henriette Weber, a UWC Music alumnus, succeeded Prof. Basson in 2011 when he retired as director after 35 years of service at UWC, due to deteriorating health, at the age of 70. Prof. Brian O’Connell retired as Rector and Vice-Chancellor in 2014, and from 2015 to 2019, the CPA continued its reporting line under Prof. Tyrone Pretorius.
In July 2019, the CPA’s new reporting line moved to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Academic, Prof. Vivienne Lawack, while working closely with the Community Engagement Unit and the Director, Prof. Priscilla Daniels and her team.
INTRODUCTION
The CPA’s transformation and extended strategic focus provides an opportunity to define its role in the learning and teaching environment, both academically and for students as performers on stage.
Academically, the Intermediate and Advanced Programmes in Music are due for review in order to meet the needs of music education, community music and inclusive education, as the CPA prepares for the changing learning and teaching environment, research-led interventions and the Fourth Industrial revolution along with all its new emerging technologies. In addition, the CPA wishes to include the other performing arts activities such as dance, movement, drama and theatre-in-education to the performing arts portfolio on offer.
PROGRAMMES IN MUSIC
The Intermediate Programme in Music & the Advanced Programme in Music 
The two accredited Music Courses offered are the Intermediate Programme in Music and Advanced Programme in Music. These courses were designed to facilitate the training and development of community music practitioners, including:
Learners completing music as a matric subject and wishing to register at UWC faculties while pursuing music studies
Learners still attending school or any other higher education institution
The programmes are extracurricular and accredited under Continuous Education.

Dcas Partnership (Department Of Cultural Affairs & Sport (Western Cape Government)
In 2015, UWC entered a 3-year partnership agreement with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport (DCAS). The funding made it possible for 20 community musicians to register at the Centre for the Performing Arts for the Intermediate or Advanced Programmes in Music. DCAS selected students from the West Coast (Saldanha, Riebeeck Kasteel), Ocean View, Khayelitsha, Gugulethu and Hermanus to participate in these programmes. Due to travelling time from Hermanus, a teacher from Hermanus was contracted to teach voice. The partnership agreement was extended beyond the 3 years and concluded in December 2019. We thank the Department of Cultural Affairs and Sport for providing the financial support to enable community musicians to improve their skills and share these skills in their communities.

In 2017, a music programme for blind and visually impaired learners in the Early Childhood Development class at the Athlone School for the Blind was started.

In this time of rapid and complex digital transformation of societies, the core focus of the CoLab for eInclusion and Social Innovation is working towards an inclusive approach for maximum participation in the competitive global digital society and economy. 
Over the past several years digital technologies and devices have indeed spread rapidly, have become ubiquitous and pervasive and have, in many instances, boosted growth, created opportunities and improved service delivery. Yet, their aggregate impact (the digital dividend) has fallen short and is unevenly distributed (Digital Dividend, 2016 World Bank report).
Within the context of this digital shift or transformation, working towards an inclusive approach for maximum participation in the competitive global digital society and economy, constitutes the core focus of the CoLab for eInclusion and Social Innovation.
In this space it plays a thought leadership, academic and change facilitator role focusing on the following activities: 
Understanding the digital divide(s) and the implications thereof for the South African society.
Engaging with multi-stakeholders for skills and capability development for participation in the digital economy (leadership skills, digital skills, institutional capability development, digital transformation etc).
Finding and developing ways to achieve digital inclusion, especially – but not only – in marginalised communities and groups.
Understanding and supporting the role of intermediaries to facilitate digital skills and capability development for digital inclusion (interventions).
Exploring the implications of the digital economy for organisations, and for small businesses (SMEs), and developing interventions, or advising there-of.
Doing social innovation through the use of digital means.
Doing research and developing research capability to underpin progress in all of these areas.
The CoLab forms the Western Cape point of presence and role-playing for the national e-skills programme under the auspices of NEMISA (becoming iNeSI, the iKamva National e-Skills Institute).
We deliver on our mandate by engaging in Projects and Interventions; Research; Digital Skills Development; Thought Leadership and Multi-Stakeholder collaborations focused on e-Inclusion and Social Innovation.
Our aim is to contribute towards the competitiveness of South Africa within the Digital Economy.

Co-curricular Record is a platform designed to recognise UWC students’ active participation in various co-curricular activities as part of their holistic student life experience.
This platform enables students to apply for official recognition of their co-curricular involvement and successes, which include experiential learning, transfer of skills and inhabiting certain attributes that facilitate their development and growth. These attributes are intended to prepare students as critical and responsible citizens, contributing to the social and economic wellbeing of students on campus and broader focus on society. The focus of the co-curricular involvement goes beyond attending a workshop or training programme, but places an emphasis on demonstrable skills and attributes that have been acquired to competently undertake and fulfil given tasks or assignments.
The Co-curricular application becomes a record once the successful applicants are approved by the adjudication panel and they become eligible for an Official University Co-Curricular Certificate or Record.
At this stage, the Co-curricular recognition is focusing on campus-based programmes and projects, alongside other meritorious and academic achievements. In case you think you are missing out, in preparation for the growth of the platform, the programme team has already established a process for the inclusion of other student involvement and experience activities, programmes and projects.
Please note that the applicant is allowed only 500 characters when filling each application per category. Each category contains criteria that are applicable which an applicant should be familiar with. Please ensure that you fill in the relevant information and where evidence is needed, you are required to include clear and verifiable submission in the designated mandatory spaces. Provide the correct details of the contact person or referee. A reference report by a relevant UWC staff member (referee) is a requirement for each application.

James Campbell was born on the 15th January 1964 in Glasgow, Scotland and later moved to Cape Town, South Africa just before he was three years of age with his parents having immigrated to this country. After having attended Parow Central Primary and Fairmont High School and working in entirely different fields, the intuitive fascination with plants as intellectual beings and what part they play in the health and wellbeing of the human race (and the earth as a whole), started to consciously come to the fore.
He completed a four-year diploma in Phytotherapy obtained from the College of Phytotherapy (Herbal Medicine) England, which formed the academic foundation to further feed the desire for knowledge and understanding of herbal medicine / medicinal plants, their healing ability, nutritional value, safety and so forth. Furthermore, he completed his MSc (Cum Laude) through the South African Herbal Science and Medicine Institute (SAHSMI), Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and is currently busy with a PhD at the Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, UWC.
The topic for his master’s was ‘The impact of storage time and seasonal harvesting on biomarker levels of Lessertia frutescens’ and at present he is investigating the impact climate change may have on an indigenous medicinal plant of South Africa for his PhD, titled ‘The impact of drought and salinity on physiology and antioxidant activity in Leonotis leonurus’.
He was the Director of the School of Natural Medicine (SoNM), Faculty of Community and Health Sciences at UWC for 11 years, as well as the Coordinator of the Phytotherapy programme. Having stepped down from Directorship in order to focus on professional and personal development, he remains the Coordinator of the Phytotherapy programme for SoNM. Balancing leadership of SoNMl, coordinating the Phytotherapy programme, coordinating the community engagement initiatives for the School, full time lecturing and supervising at the clinics, serving as a board member on the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA), with private practice and postgraduate part-time studies has been an enlightening, life changing and rewarding experience.
He has attended many national and international conferences/seminars pertaining to traditional medicine either in China, India or South Africa, either as session chair or keynote speaker. Three stand out events for him was the signing of Memorandum of Understanding: Central Council for research in Unani Medicine, Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi / University of the Western Cape, Bellville, Republic of South Africa, Signed in New Dehli on the 06 August 2010.
Hands down his favourite subject is materia medica, taught to the B Complementary Medicines (Phytotherapy) fourth- and fifth-year students, as well as herbal medicine lectured to the Naturopathic fourth year students. Other focal areas are herbal pharmacology, herbal pharmacy, herbal nutrition, preventative medicine, diet and lifestyle, environmental influences on plants and their constituents, as well as energetics. The ‘bigger picture’, the philosophy of the ‘whole is greater than the sum of its parts’ and wisdom from a diversity of ancestors - how does it all tie in to our physical, mental and spiritual well-being.
Believing education plays a fundamental role in achieving a greater understanding and possible commitment and accountability as an individual for one’s own healthcare. Yet how is this achieved while communities throughout South Africa living in rural areas, low cost housing developments and informal settlements on the outskirts of towns and cities are being adversely affected by the increased number of illnesses presenting. While the world today strives towards globalization and becoming more similar through this process, simultaneously it continues to increase in diversity. One would need to understand the complications of the illness, the environment, possible nutritional application and food/medicinal gardens concepts, while educating that without the natural world, environment and the plant world who knows until it is possibly too late.

An alumnus of Harold Cressy High School, a school that played a significant role during the apartheid years. Many of the teachers were actively involved in the anti-apartheid movement and greatly impacted their students. After completing matric, she earned a B Soc Sc at the University of Cape Town, majoring in Psychology and Public Administration. Thereafter, she completed an HDE (PG) and entered the teaching profession, choosing to teach in underprivileged areas. Due to the issues she became aware of while teaching, she enrolled in and completed a B.Ed (PG) degree at the University of the Western Cape, and went on to earn a Master’s degree (M.Ed) at the same university.
While living in Auckland, New Zealand, she became aware of the wide variety of complementary medicine courses available in the country. As her interest in complementary medicine grew, she became drawn to naturopathy and began searching for courses to study in that field. She applied to the University of the Western Cape to pursue a BSc in Complementary Medicine followed by a postgraduate B Com Medicine in Naturopathy. Upon acceptance, she returned to Cape Town.
She was elected to serve on the Public Board of Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Phytotherapy of the Allied Health Professions Council, serving from 2012 to 2020. In 2021, she was elected to the Allied Health Professions Council as the naturopathy representative, and in 2022, she became the Chairperson of the Council, a position she currently holds. She began teaching in the School of Natural Medicine in the Naturopathy modality, and in 2014, she was appointed coordinator of the Naturopathy program, a position she still occupies. As a result of the challenges facing naturopathy, she completed a PhD in Naturopathy, one of the few in Africa. Her thesis title is ""A model for Naturopathy within the South African Healthcare system."" Due to the research generated from her PhD, she was able to benchmark the naturopathy program to international standards, develop a model to demonstrate how naturopathy can work in a public healthcare system and developed a new curriculum for the teaching of Naturopathy, grounded in South African culture and aligned with legislative requirements. Graduates of the program can be found in private practice, working as Naturopaths in international health resorts and in various positions within the health system.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/all-areas-of-study/units/uwc-nature-reserve-unit/overview,"UWC Nature Reserve Unit Overview
The concept of a nature reserve on the University of the Western Cape's campus originated in the early 1960s through the keen interest of a group of academics attached to the University. Through careful planning the idea reached realisation in 1977 with the official proclamation of the Cape Flats Nature Reserve under Section 12(4) of the Nature Conservation Ordinance of 1974. In 1978 the reserve became a National Monument, today known as a Provincial Heritage site.
Privately owned and managed by the University of the Western Cape, the reserve occupies 25% of the campus.
Although the reserve was first created as a refuge for Strandveld and Coastal Fynbos, it now functions as a base for ecological teaching, environmental education and research.
The reserve occurs on an Ecotone and protects endangered Cape Flats Dune Strandveld and critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. The Cape Flats has the highest number of threatened plant species per unit area of remaining vegetation in the world making the Cape Flats Nature Reserve an important core conservation site.
Endemic to the Western Cape and threatened by urbanisation, alien vegetation, sand mining and too frequent fires; a mere 49% remains of the endangered Cape Flats Dune Strandveld.
Conservation efforts are proving beneficial through rehabilitation and legislation where 6% was under formal protection and that has increased to 19%.
Once the most widespread vegetation type in Cape Town, but due to development, there is an irreversible loss and sadly only small patches of this ecosystem remain and even less protected.
Despite a national recovery target of 30%, the remaining percentage continues to drop and is currently at 14%. Unfortunately, not all remaining vegetation falls within protected areas, leaving only 1% under formal protection.
Less than 10ha of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos remains within this reserve with visible evidence of disturbance. Due to the small size of the reserve and its urban location, one of the biggest concerns to this ecosystem is that water tables can easily be altered and polluted as a result of surrounding urban areas.
There are three major ecosystems within the reserve: a Wetland, Flats (Flatlands) and Dunes. Together they contain over 220 plant species including Red List species like the vulnerable Leucospermum hypophyllocarpodendron hypophyllocarpodendron (protea) and endangered Lessertia argentea.
Some 20 species of mammals have been recorded in the reserve including caracal, grysbok, mongoose, genet, polecat, moles and mole rats and many other smaller species of rodent. Over 100 bird species surveyed, including birds of prey such as the Black shouldered kite, Rock kestrel and Spotted Eagle Owl and a variety of smaller species. Several species of reptiles are also found in the reserve including the Cape dwarf chameleon and Angulate tortoise.
This urban reserve with its central location holds lots of research and training potential for students and researchers. There are many short trails through the dunes, dune depressions, flats and past the seasonal wetland with a bird hide.
You can switch from one trail to the next at any of the intersection points or just relax at the picnic areas.
Groups can book guided tours through the endangered Cape Flats Dune Strandveld, critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos and seasonal wetland, or they can enter on their own or join the weekly PhotoWalk; which has already provided several species list additions.
The University of the Western Cape is the proud owner of the 34ha Cape Flats Nature Reserve. Though first created as a refuge for Strandveld and Coastal Fynbos, it now functions as a base for ecological training, environmental education and research and serves as an excellent outdoor classroom for gaining an ecological understanding of the Cape's dwindling natural areas.
Cape Flats Nature Reserve is one of the most important floral conservation sites in the Cape Lowlands, since only small fragments are formally conserved. The reserve consists of three major floristic regions: Vlei, Flats and Dunes with around 220 indigenous plants species recorded. Other than plants, animals present in the reserve include caracal, grysbok and other small mammals like mongoose, various reptiles and over 100 bird species. 
This urban reserve with its central location holds lots of research and training potential for students. As learners grow up in a largely urbanised environment, often they become disconnected from their natural environment.
Most schools in the Cape Peninsula, especially those situated on the Cape Flats, are often characterised as being under-resourced and challenged. Environmental Education is an attempt to reconnect them. 
Tailor-made environmental education programmes comply with the school curriculum, with the focus on enjoying nature by working very closely with learners, students, educators and many other organisations. 
Our aim is to develop an awareness and understanding of the inter-relationships between the natural, social, economic and political environment. We hope that by reconnecting students with nature, will inspire them to find a new appreciation for their natural surroundings, thus having an important bearing on future decision-making by the same individuals.
For more information or bookings, contact Laurenda van Breda - Lvanbreda@uwc.ac.za / 021 95 3274
The main objectives of our nursery are to:
Encourage planting and growing indigenous plants to protect our natural heritage.
Advise and train communities/schools in and around the Cape Flats on how they can start their own indigenous gardens to promote our unique Cape Flora and create miniature nature reserves for our pollinators to survive
Support greening initiatives on and off campus by our students and surrounding community.
UWC’s Indigenous Nursery runs monthly Plant Sales which is open to the general public in order to generate interest in water-wise indigenous plants. The main objective is to interact with the community, educate, create awareness and to help green neighbourhoods.
2024 Plant Sale dates

We advise on propagation, planting and maintenance thereafter, which gives our participating communities a sense of ownership. Through these initiatives participating communities get to appreciate their natural surroundings leading to a positive attitude towards nature.

The School of Government building at UWC 
The School of Government was established by the University of the Western Cape (UWC) in 1993 as part of a broader initiative to meet the education and training challenges of a post-apartheid society as well as a means of supporting the process of social, political and economic transformation in South Africa and the African region. It provides professional and academic training for the public sector at national, provincial and local levels, for NGOs, trade unions and other related organisations, and also engages in research, consultancy and policy advice. 
Through its experienced and cosmopolitan staff, the School provides professional and academic training of personnel for the public sector at national, provincial and local levels, as well as for NGOs, trade unions, academic institutions and other related organisations. It also engages in research, consultancy and policy advice, and has contributed to a number of White Papers and other key policy documents at the national, provincial and local government levels.
Through its core staff, constituent units, and its links with African and international tertiary institutions, the School offers a range of inter-disciplinary courses at the certificate, undergraduate and postgraduate levels, to both full-time and part-time students, in areas such as governance and public management, public policy, development studies, citizenship and democracy, land and agrarian studies. 
About Us
The postgraduate programmes are delivered in teaching blocks, thereby catering to the needs of both full-time and part-time students. As the course offerings are quite broad and the programme quite demanding, it is important that you make the choices that meet your needs and pace yourself accordingly. The following online orientation programme provides information that can guide you in this regard, so please read it carefully.
The School of Government was established in 1993 as part of a broader initiative to meet the education and training challenges of a post-apartheid society as well as a means of supporting the process of social, political and economic transformation in South Africa. It provides professional and academic training for the public sector at national, provincial and local levels, for NGOs, trade unions and other related organisations, and also engages in research, consultancy and policy advice.
While stressing the development of basic professional skills and competencies, the School also emphasises the promotion of a democratic ethos and more people-centred forms of governance. Originally conceived as a School of Public Administration, it was renamed the School of Government to reflect its focus on a broader vision of governance, informed by disciplines including public administration and management, political science, economics, international relations and development studies.
It is committed to supporting the training and research needs of community-based organisations, non-governmental organisations, trade unions and other institutions of the wider South African society, to help the development of balance between the state and civil society. As a constituent party of the Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences, the School is committed to the following: 
​​​​committed to education,
concern for local, national and global issues,
lifelong learning to enhance the quality of life and development of people,
participation and co-determination,
programmes based on research-generated knowledge, and
equal opportunities for employment and advancement in society."
https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/all-areas-of-study/units/academic-literacy-programme-alc,"Academic Literacy Programme (ALC) Overview
ALP’s vision is to:
Support and develop first-year students registered in the Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences in terms of their academic literacy practices, digital literacy abilities and critical thinking skills;
Enable students to transfer the skills they acquire in the ALP to their other modules in their respective degree programmes, in their personal and professional lives; and
Continuously improving the learning and teaching in the ALP and the Faculty.
The mission is realised through:
Presenting student-centred modules by using innovative and blended learning and teaching pedagogies;
Liaising and collaborating with the cognate departments in the faculty to create synergy between the content of the academic literacy modules and those of the discipline-specific modules in the faculty; and
Employing well-qualified, motivated and experienced staff members to provide a holistic learning experience for undergraduate students in the faculty.
History
The Academic Literacies Programme was previously part of the faculty's Department of Academic Development (ADD). The ADD was established as an academic department at the end of 2006 because the previous Dean, Prof Christopher Tapscott (now retired), the faculty as a whole and the staff members at that time regarded it as needed and necessary. The department consisted of the Academic Literacy Team, the Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP) and the EMS Student Research and Support Unit (ESSRU). The mainstream first-year Academic Literacy modules and all the ECP modules were taught in the ADD. The ESSRU supported at-risk students in the ECP programme. Hence, the ADD was also established to provide moral and social support to the undergraduate students in the EMS faculty. 
The department was disestablished at the end of June 2020, after the university reviewed all its extended curriculum programmes in 2019. The ECP staff members were integrated within the different cognate departments in the faculty, and the academics responsible for teaching the Academic Literacy modules were grouped under the Academic Literacies Programme (ALP).
Since the ADD’s inception in 2006, it has seen significant success through students who have completed their undergraduate and post-graduate studies. Some have completed their PhDs and become colleagues, giving back as alumni to their alma mater and making indelible marks in their respective professions, nationally and internationally. These graduates credit their academic and career successes to the ALP that enabled them to foster a vision of life-long learning. 
The current staff complement of the ALP is:
Prof Venicia McGhie: Coordinator and responsible for teaching ALC 131 and 132, ALC 130, and ALF 111
Dr Lutasha Abrahams-Ndesi: Responsible for teaching ALC 131 and 132 and ALF 111
Miss Parveen Paleker: Responsible for teaching ALC 131 and 132 and ALF 111

Fair Share was established in 1997, as a response to a need for a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) to play an active role in economic policy development processes. From this broad intention, Fair Share has evolved into an organisation that meaningfully strengthens the capacity of various stakeholders to participate in the socio-economic development processes of their communities.
The capacity building programmes and activities of Fair Share are founded on the understanding that successful communities require knowledgeable, active and assertive CSO's and elected local representatives. Thus, Fair Share's quest to design and implement programmes that: 
Increase understanding of local governance.
Improve the understanding of communities with new regard to municipal planning and budgeting processes.
Improve the participation of various stakeholders in local governance processes.
Facilitate community networks to develop and strengthen their advocacy strategies.
Provide research and information support to community organisations, and
The above objectives are purposefully pursued through structured activities to allow Fair Share to realise its vision and mission.
Vision
To contribute to effective and accountable governance responsive to the needs of marginalised people. 
Mission
Fair Share, a unit of the School of Government, based at the University of the Western Cape, strives to build the capacity of communities to participate effectively in democratic governance, by building the capacity of relevant community structures and organisations."

Preamble to the Small Business Clinic (SBC)
Overview of the SBC (Short Overview)
The Economic and Management Sciences (EMS) Faculty at UWC aspires to become a Faculty of impact and opportunity for both students and relevant stakeholders. Through its focus on developing students who are able to engage critically and analytically in the social, political, economic and technological spheres of society, the faculty is attuned to opportunities that will contribute to the development and growth of its students and enable them to transition more smoothly into the world of work, while simultaneously achieving its strategic objective of positively impacting the broader society. Therefore, the reconceptualization of the Enterprise Development Unit (EDU) is necessary to ensure the faculty’s responsiveness to the growing demand for graduates who are adequately prepared to enter the world of work. Youth entrepreneurship in the 21st century allows the faculty to strategically position itself through the creation of an experiential learning hub that elevates interest in entrepreneurship through a focus on small business development and support. Our entrepreneurial nature is aptly articulated through the sentiments of Muhammad Yunus (cited in Morris et al. 2018, 21):
Human beings are not born to work for anybody else. For millions of years, we were on the planet, we never worked for anybody. We are go-getters. We are farmers. We are hunters. We lived in caves, and we found our own food. We didn’t send job applications. So, this is our tradition.
Entrepreneurship has become a key focus of interest over the past three to four decades, given the potential opportunities for economic development and job creation. It is widely acknowledged as a driver of sustainable economic growth as it is the entrepreneurs who create new businesses, drive and shape innovation, speed up structural changes in the economy, introduce new competition and often create further income opportunities for others in the form of employment, thereby contributing to productivity (Praag and Versloot, 2008). However, entrepreneurship cannot be stereotyped and can take on many forms (GEM South Africa Report, 2023). Entrepreneurial activity takes place across the age spectrum, with most of the activity occurring in the 25 to 44 year age bracket, but is found most prevalent among younger people who are below the age of 34 years. It is in this bracket that most countries, both in the developed and developing world, have their main challenges. There are currently over 4 million youth in South Africa who are unemployed and, in many cases, are unemployable due to their chronic lack of education (Stats SA, 2023). Entrepreneurship is considered one of the key approaches to addressing the problem of youth unemployment in South Africa. In addition, the Global Entrepreneurial Monitor (GEM) Report of 2023 illustrates the appetite that individuals in South Africa have for entrepreneurship. Social attitudes towards entrepreneurship show a positive upward trend from 2003 to 2021, with a slight dip in 2022. However, there has been a slight decrease between 2021 to 2022 in the number of individuals who see entrepreneurship as a good career choice. This ranges from 81,8% in 2021 to 79,8% in 2022. Those considering entrepreneurship to hold a high status in the community, ranged from 81,9% to 79,8%, while those who perceived good opportunities increased from 57,9% in 2021 to 61,3% in 2022. Perceived capabilities declined from 69,7% in 2021 to 63,7% in 2022. Fear of failure also reduced from 53% in 2021 to 51,3% in 2022. Moreover, the total early-stage entrepreneurial activity index for South Africa increased from 6.9% in 2016 to 11.0% in 2017, remained above 10% until 2019, but then fell back to 8,5% in 2022.
However, entrepreneurial activity in the absence of sound management and financial practices will not yield the economic gains intended to reduce the burden of social welfare on the state. A newspaper article highlighted the problems that small business owners face in trying to secure finances to start or grow their businesses. The article referred to the lack of a savings culture in South Africa, despite various initiatives to encourage South Africans to “save for a rainy day.” More specifically, small business owners require access to knowledgeable and competent individuals who can offer advice on how to manage business finances for growth, saving for slow business periods, planning for their retirement, etc. This identifies the first need that the faculty is well-positioned to fill:
The need for entrepreneurial skills development and the provision of information and knowledge related to managing a small business.
In spite of the potential gains that resonate in becoming an entrepreneur, many of the youth do not possess the start-up skills necessary to start a small business (Business Report 8 June 2017), which may affect their appetite for entrepreneurship.
Therefore, a clinic that brings different role-players together can contribute to facilitating the youth’s interest in entrepreneurship. In general, the experiential learning hub idea will allow for small business owners to make use of the services that the Clinic provides with respect to: 
advice on planning to start a small business,
sustaining and growing a business (focusing on the various functional areas, including Human Resource Management, Information Systems, Marketing, Operations, Public Relations etc.)
Financial management of the business.
Students will be supervised by their academic mentors, business owners, and role-players from industry, government, professional bodies and agencies supporting small businesses. The learning hub will facilitate the co-curricular approach adopted by the UWC in preparing students for the changing world of work. This entails a focus on awareness of expanded opportunities of employment for our students/graduates that transcends seeking employment, through them becoming creators of employment.
Providing opportunities for students who wish to work in the financial sector to gain practical experience in that field.
Therefore, the focus on financial management and planning will serve multiple purposes, which includes:
financial literacies,
financial planning advice, and
Garnering of practical experience in finance in general.
Given the above context, the need for a more impactful unit that encompasses attention to the development of knowledge, practical skills and competencies of students and graduates arises. To this end, we envisage a two-fold purpose. Firstly, it will contribute to the enhancement of the skills and competencies of our students in the areas of entrepreneurship through a focus on support to small business development. Secondly, it will foster an appetite for entrepreneurship through good practice life stories shared by business owners who make use of the services of the Clinic, and those involved as mentors to our students. Thirdly, it will contribute to the faculty becoming more practically engaged with challenges or problems facing the small and micro-enterprise sector, and partnering and collaborating towards remedies or challenges.
The Clinic has the following four key objectives:
1.1 To educate students in Entrepreneurship through practical experiences that facilitate the integration of theory and application.
The activities that will occur within the Clinic will afford senior students in the economic and management sciences (i) the opportunity of applying theory to practice and (ii) completing practical activities/assessments that will contribute to their workplace readiness. Amongst others, it is envisaged that senior/postgraduate students will engage with small business owners (under the supervision of academic and business mentors; government agencies, industry partners, certified financial planners, professional bodies). Specific activities that students will engage in include: 
Business Proposal Writing;
business process mapping for growth and sustainability; and
financial literacies (savings and investments), and
participation in workshops and seminars.
1.2 To develop social values towards entrepreneurship
As mentioned earlier, South Africa experiences one of the highest rates of youth unemployment globally. Youth entrepreneurship is one approach to addressing the problem of youth unemployment. To this end, the Clinic will contribute in two ways.
Firstly, through the face-to-face interactions with small business owners through which students will obtain first-hand information on the opportunities resonant in entrepreneurship. Secondly, students will be afforded the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge about entrepreneurship, management and finance in a practical way as they interact with small business owners that make use of the services of the Clinic. Ultimately, the activities that occur within the Clinic will contribute to the development of pro-social values towards entrepreneurship. 
1.3 To offer mentorship to students and small business owners
The Clinic will be carefully structured to promote pro-entrepreneurial values and become a driver for social change by developing a culture where entrepreneurship is elevated. Academic experts and professionals in the fields of entrepreneurship, management and finance will act as mentors to the students by overseeing student activity and advice to clients. Small business owners will also be offered mentorship through occasional workshop series on topics within the purview of the Clinic and the allocation of mentors from industry and other relevant sectors. Business proposal writing and financial literacies workshops and talks (ICT’s HR, Financial Planning, Marketing and Sales etc.) could be offered by academic subject experts and professionals from industry, the public sector or government agencies, including SEDA. Senior students will shadow their mentors. Retired business owners will also be invited as business mentors to participate in the activities of the Clinic. 
1.4 To advance research in the area of entrepreneurship, management and finance.
The research goal of the faculty is to increase cutting-edge EMS research outputs which advances societal transformation and development. One of our research niche areas is Entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is envisaged that the Clinic will contribute to advancing empirically based qualitative research, that could be used for the development of case studies to enhance teaching methodologies and students’ learning. The university has appointed a Research Chair in Entrepreneurship in Higher Education. The Chair is leading research in Entrepreneurship in various ways, which also includes the supervision of PhD candidates. It is envisaged that these candidates will also contribute to the activities of the Clinic. A number of colleagues across disciplines in the faculty are involved in projects related to Entrepreneurship and Small Business development.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/all-areas-of-study/niche-area/politics-and-urban-governance-research-group-pug,"Politics and Urban Governance Research Group (...
The Politics and Urban Governance Research Group (PUG) was founded in February 2023 with the mission to ""connect research on urban politics to the lived experiences of citizens, and uphold a commitment to integrity, collaboration, and social impact."" Three core objectives underpin PUG’s work. First, to better understand all forms of governance in low-income or vulnerable urban communities through building long-term research partnerships with residents and civil society in informal settlements. Second, to use research as a platform to link residents to decision-makers and power holders by fostering participatory spaces that support inclusive debate. Third, to influence decision-making and policies related to urban governance and human rights through research, inclusive dialogue, and co-design.
The rationale behind PUG's work is to use research to support social justice values and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in highly unequal societies. The Research Group recognises the importance of amplifying the voices of marginalised groups with care. PUG is located in a country with one of the highest measures of inequality in the world, yet South Africa has a strong democratic ethos, a celebrated Constitution, and a motivated civil society. We understand that while there are many strengths to the design of South Africa’s urban governance system, these frameworks and practices have not led to dignified living conditions for low-income residents, especially those in informal settlements. We believe that embedded, sensitive, long-term research will allow those holding power in society (including but not limited to government policymakers) to better understand, acknowledge, and improve the realities of communities living in vulnerable conditions. We are committed to research that goes beyond technical solutions to intractable challenges, focusing instead on how governance measures rooted in the realities of informal settlements can promote social justice and contribute to the attainment of the SDGs. 
Vision
To be a leading research platform that connects research on urban politics to the lived experiences of citizens, with a commitment to achieving social impact. 
To build a research group and platform that brings together students, academics, civil society practitioners and policymakers to engage in embedded research, critical scholarship and dialogue. 
Values
The research group commits itself to an enabling and supportive environment where it is open to learning, engagement and dialogue based on the following values: 
Integrity · Honesty & Transparency · Collaboration · Empowerment · Impact · Respect
The PUG Research Group plays a vital role in advancing knowledge and understanding of urban governance, making significant contributions to both academia and the communities it serves.

The Centre for Advanced Studies of African Society (CASAS) was established in 1997 by its Founding Director, Professor Kwesi Kwaa Prah, as a Pan-African Centre that would leverage the best available African expertise and scholarship to support a network of Africans addressing questions of interest to Africa. CASAS was donated in 2018 to the University of the Western Cape (UWC) to be located in the University’s Department of Linguistics, Arts and Humanities Faculty, by CASAS Founding Director, Prof. Kwesi Kwaa Prah.
Much of the work undertaken by CASAS has been informed by an acute sense of history, including colonial interest in, and influence on, the language landscape in Africa. Thus, many of its initiatives are premised on the idea that clustering African speech-forms into sets that display an 85% level of inter-comprehension makes it possible for the majority of the population in sub-Saharan Africa to be reached via texts written in harmonised orthographies or spelling systems.
Given sub-Saharan Africa’s current population of 1.1 billion (projected to hit 2.3 billion by the year 2055), the effectiveness and efficiencies that this singular vision unlocks are enormous. There are implications for: market economics, the deployment of human talent/capacity, mass literacy and education, publishing, extension services in agriculture and health, mass mobilisation, indigenous scholarship, intra-African trade, development of information and communication technologies, and so on. This is of course besides the journeys of self-rediscovery and identity that the vision catalyses.
The core activities of CASAS include the harmonisation and standardisation of language orthographies; promotion of local languages in basic education; production and dissemination of literacy textbooks, textbooks for citizenship education, vocational and out of school training; research on African linguistics and language policies, and organisation of workshops, conferences, seminars and colloquia on various topics related to language and development. The activities include publications of books on aspects of linguistics and sociolinguistics written by individual authors or as editions of papers presented at conferences, workshops and seminars; monographs which include the orthographies and informative texts on matters of concern to the general public such as technology, health, agriculture and social issues as well as on education and linguistics; notes and records which predominantly cover areas of linguistics; primers and readers for use in schools; glossaries, monolingual dictionaries in African languages and grammars and descriptive analysis of African languages – especially those written in African languages.

https://www.uwc.ac.za/study/all-areas-of-study/centres/centre-for-humanities-research,"Centre for Humanities Research (CHR) Overview
In a rapidly shifting social context of a post-apartheid society, the reinvigorated study of the humanities offers creative possibilities for dealing with the challenges of globalisation, rapid technological change, and the legacies of colonialism and apartheid as these mark our modern world. 
To this end, the CHR, which was made a flagship project in the Humanities by the DSI-NRF in 2015, is unique in developing partnerships across and between institutions, particularly universities, schools, public arts projects, museums, archives and art galleries, and nurturing future generations of humanities graduates, educators and cultural practitioners. 
Established in 2006 and informed by its institutional location and history, the CHR pursues questions from the south that have a significant impact for locating intellectual traditions in Africa in a global discourse on the contemporary human condition. The CHR builds a discourse on the humanities that is responsive to nurturing an engagement with the concept of the post-apartheid and explores the relationship between the human and technology in our contemporary world, especially as this relates to rapidly changing notions of society and politics. It also develops synergy between academic scholarship, postgraduate training and cultural production extending the reach of local and international humanities scholarship, as well as opportunities for arts education and cultural production into communities on the Cape Flats. 
Beyond public commitments, the CHR has championed Humanities’ questions at the institutional site of the university and in postgraduate education. The CHR’s postgraduate fellowship programme, broadly anchored in an annual Winter School programme with national and international partner institutions, a year-long reading programme, and the weekly South African Contemporary History and Humanities Seminar, has emerged as a leading critical space in South Africa for graduate education in the Humanities. The CHR’s postgraduate training pipeline has seen CHR fellows appointed across the South African Higher Education as well as public institutions, contributing greatly to the transformation of these sectors.
As part of UWC’s multi-sited campus plan, and as a research priority at UWC attentive to its commitments to bridge the divides between the institution and its publics, as well as the racial divides that mark the city of Cape Town and its relationship with its rural surrounds, the CHR has overseen the development of a major art and research facility on Greatmore Street, Woodstock. 
A commitment that formed part of the CHR’s initial flagship proposal to the National Research Foundation (NRF), the Greatmore initiative allows for increased mobility across the apartheid divides that structure the life of the city. To this end, the Greatmore initiative will accommodate several of the projects already inaugurated by the CHR namely a laboratory of kinetic objects, an artists in residence programme, inquiries into concepts and practices of sound, image and movement and an initiative on translations of the Humanities. 
The Greatmore building with its exhibition, film, laboratory, photographic, music, specialist lecture, study and visiting scholar spaces, enables the CHR’s vision to be further translated into public domains and along new lines of inquiry.

The central brief of the Centre for Multilingualism and Diversities Research (CMDR) is to embark on a project of intellectual reorientation, namely a significant rethinking of multilingualism and the development of a new discourse with which to approach interdisciplinary work in the humanities and the education sciences. The brief involves interrogating contemporary and historical African intellectual heritage through a critical review of the role of language and multilingualism in the colonial archive and in the light of critical framings of multilingualism and diversity. 
Such an endeavour requires new modes of theoretical engagement, which in turn involves engaging with linguistic diversity in it multiple manifestations, local representations and practices by providing careful historiography of linguistic diversity and a critical analysis of contemporary deliberation on multilingualism across academia and society at large. To this end, the centre seeks to provide an intellectual space to further a critical rethinking of what kinds of questions we should be asking of language, literary and cultural study, strengthening existing interdisciplinary projects or leading to new ones, and enabling challenging questions to be asked of the disciplines themselves in the reconstitution of a post-apartheid humanities."

The Desmond Tutu Centre for Religion and Social Justice is a research centre headed up by the Desmond Tutu SARChI Research Chair in Religion and Social Justice, Director Professor Sarojini Nadar (an NRF B-rated Researcher). The Desmond Tutu Centre's scholars challenge – contextually, theoretically, and methodologically – asymmetrical systems of power and commonly accepted assumptions about the social world and human experiences. 
The greatest strength of the Centre is the diversity of its researchers at all levels working under its auspices. The Centre champions research and teaching that endeavours to explore, excavate, and explain the multiple and complex ways that these research areas, questions, topics, and projects intersect. 
The Centre has five main thematic focus areas; Religion and Gender, Religion and the Economy, Religion and the Environment, Religion and Politics, and Religion and Education. Given the transdisciplinary philosophy of the Centre, these thematic foci do not function as discrete categories but rather as guidelines for illustrating the depth and breadth of the Centre’s undertakings. 
The African Journal of Gender and Religion (AJGR) is a bi-annual publication housed in the Centre. It is the first, online, peer-reviewed, open-access journal for the transdisciplinary study of gender and religion in Africa.

The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has a new Research Chair in Forensic Linguistics and Multilingualism. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Research and Innovation, Professor José Frantz, funds the chair as part of her initiative to create a strategic funding instrument aimed at strengthening research and innovation capacity, enhancing the training of a new generation of researchers, and developing established researchers in all knowledge areas.
This Research Chair is the first of its kind in South Africa and Africa. Forensic Linguistics is a relatively new field of study in South Africa, though it is well established in places like the USA, the UK, and Australia.
Forensic Linguistics deals with language and the law. Arguably language is law, and law is language. Law, after all, deals with the art of persuasion, which has language at its core. The importance of this relationship is particularly relevant in a multilingual and multicultural society such as South Africa. It is essential to empower lawyers, linguists, or language practitioners to understand this vital link. This will avoid certain cases being decided on cultural and linguistic misunderstandings, for example, where there is no equivalence of meaning dealing with a specific word in an African language and its English translation.
This Research Chair aims to build the research area of Forensic Linguistics in multilingual Africa. According to Coulthard and Johnson (2010), in The Routledge Handbook of Forensic Linguistics, this discipline ‘… is an attempt to improve the delivery of justice using language analysis.’ This involves a three-pronged approach where Forensic Linguists can look at the study of legal texts, the linguistic study of the legal process, and investigative linguistics. Forensic Linguistic research is highly interdisciplinary, involving disciplines such as linguistics, psychology, criminology, policing and law. This research will improve access to justice and ensure that the constitutional mandate for language rights is practically implemented and realised. It will contribute to civil society and help to build a research corpus through ground-breaking research at UWC. Additionally, this interdisciplinary research will contribute to improving the current legal system and understanding of multilingualism.
It is imperative to begin somewhere on the African continent to position the study of Forensic Linguistics and Multilingualism. Hosting conferences and creating research throughputs (submitting publications and registering postgraduate students) will form part of the collaborative work with interested members in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities.
The main aim is to set up the first Forensic Linguistics (Language and Law) and Multilingualism Research Chair/Centre in Africa. It will offer Honours, Master’s and PhD programmes in Forensic Linguistics and collaborate with other interested parties at UWC, including Forensic History as well as multilingualism and social justice. A full-time Honours course in Forensic Linguistics has already been approved and will be offered in the Department of African Language Studies this year. The research projects that are envisaged fall under the broad areas of Forensic Linguistics, now an internationally recognised field, but a field that is yet to be firmly established in South Africa and on the African continent. This will make the Research Chair completely unique, and it will fill a niche area where little or no research has been done. 
This Research Chair is occupied by Professor Russell H Kaschula, a linguist and lawyer based in the Department of African Language Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities."

IsiXhosa is South Africa’s second most popular mother tongue, spoken as a first language by 8.2 million South Africans. Despite the popularity of the language, there is limited expertise in the teaching of early literacy (reading and writing) in isiXhosa (and other African languages) in Teacher Education in South Africa.
UWC-CALT aims to contribute to the development of isiXhosa as a language of teaching and learning in primary schools, and is also geared towards developing Teacher Education for enabling the teaching of – and in – isiXhosa at primary school level.
The Centre partners with three universities in the Eastern Cape where isiXhosa is widely spoken and taught as a home language, namely: Walter Sisulu University, The University of Fort Hare and Rhodes University. 
CALT (isiXhosa) will: 
Be responsible for strengthening the quality of literacy teaching and learning in isiXhosa in Teacher Education, with a particular focus on the BEd (Foundation Phase) Programme.
Focus on the teaching of reading in isiXhosa at the foundation phase, that is from Grades R to 3. 
Develop a cadre of young teachers who become experts in the teaching of reading in isiXhosa at the foundation phase level.
Ensure that young speakers of isiXhosa are able to shift from learning to read to reading to learn. 
Disseminate high quality research in this field via scholarly publications, workshops, conferences, fellowships, postgraduate teaching, and supervision.
Objectives
CALT (isiXhosa) will:
Strengthen the quality of isiXhosa literacy teaching and learning in Teacher Education through developing professional programmes in this field.
Develop research capacity and scholarship through PhD and Master's programmes that will inform literacy practice in African languages, particularly in isiXhosa.
Build a community of practice by engaging in public education through seminars, conferences and publications on the teaching of reading and broader literacy.
Develop and pilot the use of teaching and learning support materials in isiXhosa in Teacher Education. 
Engage with organisations pursuing similar goals in and beyond South Africa.
Key activities
CALT (isiXhosa) will focus on the following areas: 
Capacity building
Research and publications
Teaching and supervision 
Community engagement and advocacy"

Who we are
The Science Learning Centre for Africa (SLCA) is the community engagement extension of the School of Science and Mathematics Education (SSME), in the Faculty of Education, University of the Western Cape.
The SLCA has made a significant impact on improving science education in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape, through the construction of science laboratories in rural schools. To date, 84 such laboratories have been constructed.
The main focus of the SLCA is however to, with the assistance of our corporate partners, invest in the professional development of science, technology and mathematics teachers. The SLCA subscribes to a broader vision that the usual STEM (Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics) grouping, and embraces a STEAME (Science-Technology-Arts-Mathematics-Entrepreneurship) approach. We focus on engaging pedagogies that would stimulate learners’ interest in science, such as cooperative learning, problem-based learning, puppetry, etc., and places emphasis on promoting self-directed learning. 
Vision of the SLCA
In line with the UWC Institutional Operating Plan (2021 – 2025), the Science Learning Centre of Africa (SLCA) strives to be a Centre of Excellence, as the community engagement extension of the School of Science and Mathematics Education (SSME), engaging in STEM (science and mathematics) teacher professional development, learning programmes to popularise science amongst school learners, cutting-edge science education research, and productive relationships with funders (private and government sector) and research partners (notably national and international universities) in order to transform lives and empower communities. 
Mission Statement of the SLCA
The SLCA is a research-led centre responsive to the needs of South Africa in terms of science and mathematics education, and strives for excellence in learning, teaching, research and community outreach.
Its focus on enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, should contribute to a more equitable and dynamic society. This is pursued through dedicated teaching, high academic standards and intellectual rigour, and productive partnerships. 
Goals of the SLCA
The following six goals direct the activities of the SLCA: 
Goal 1: Continuous professional development of Science, Technology and Mathematics (STEM) teachers
Goal 2: Infrastructure, resources and initiatives to enable effective STEM teaching and learning
Goal 3: Cutting-edge research
Goal 4: Financial viability and strategic partnerships
Goal 5: Public domain: Enhanced visibility and becoming a Centre of Excellence
Goal 6: Leadership, governance and staff empowerment
“The beginning and the end”, 1995, bronze sculpture by David Hlongwane at UWC 
In an insightful article by Roger Williamson (The Conversation, 21 July 2015), the author discussed how UWC tackles the country’s societal and economic problems. He quoted UWC Vice-Chancellor Prof Tyrone Pretorius, who proclaimed the university’s commitment to “improve our neighbourhood’s capacity, accelerate economic development and bring university education in support of struggling communities”.
This is also the message echoed in the statue by artist David Hlongwane, that stands at the entrance of the UWC campus. It shows a domestic worker celebrating her son’s graduation.
UWC has communities such as Khayelitsha on its doorstep, and strives to uplift these communities. This is also encapsulated in the mission of the SLCA, to make a difference in local communities."

Dear Students,
The warmest of welcome comes your way from the Dean's office and from the Faculty of Dentistry. You have been afforded the opportunity to study at one of the most progressive universities in South Africa, which is located in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. We are also Africa's largest dental school and from the more than 12 000 applicants received, you have been selected to train either as dentists or hygienists. You represent the privileged few in this country who will have the benefit of a university education and you enter a noble profession where status, financial success, respect, social standing and opportunity can almost be guaranteed if you play by the rules. To those of you who are first generation students, i.e., you are the first in your family to enrol at university, there is an added responsibility to ensure that you succeed because the evidence has shown that if you do, then those that come after you will most likely follow the same path. This means that there is a great opportunity to ensure a whole range of benefits for you and your family.
At UWC, we are people and student centred. Your wellness and well-being is very important to us and UWC has many support structures in place that will be accessible to you all. Dear Students, the oral hygiene and dentistry programmes are not easy, you will have to work hard and sacrifice attendance to events and functions so that you meet your academic obligations, BUT also make time to enjoy student life and keep yourself healthy. These will be the best years of your life and again, I want to welcome you all to UWC and I hope that you enjoy the experience and also benefit from a world class programme offered at the Faculty of Dentistry!
Warm regards,
Prof Yengopal

The School of Natural Medicine (SoNM) is dedicated to the education and training of professionals in various disciplines of complementary health sciences, as well as research within this field. Specifically, SoNM represents the professional disciplines of Acupuncture, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy, and Unani-Tibb, which are recognised within the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) under the Department of Health. These disciplines fall under the broader umbrella of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and Traditional Medicine (TM), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cochrane Collaboration.
Natural Medicine and Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Context:
Natural medicine encompasses diverse healthcare systems that enhance the body's natural healing capacity, with or without synthetic pharmaceuticals. CAM is broadly defined as treatments that exist outside mainstream conventional medicine, encompassing a wide range of health systems, modalities, and practices based on different cultural and historical contexts. TM, as per the WHO, includes the knowledge, skills, and practices indigenous to different cultures, used for maintaining health, preventing illness, and treating physical and mental conditions. CAM and TM incorporate various treatment modalities, including nutritional medicine, lifestyle interventions, herbal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture, homoeopathy, massage therapy, energy medicine (e.g., Reiki), and mind-body techniques (e.g., meditation and yoga). 
Role of Natural Medicine in Health and Wellness Sector
Natural Medicine has a significant role in promoting health, preventing illness, and managing disease through holistic, patient-centred approaches, conventional medical knowledge and traditional knowledge systems. Patient management would be diverse between professions and based on the relevant Scope of Practice as outlined by AHPCSA. The contributions of natural medicine to healthcare are diverse and vary based on cultural, historical, and scientific perspectives. Natural medicine has numerous benefits, including preventative healthcare, integrative approaches to chronic disease and rehabilitation, expanding public access to healthcare, supporting integrative treatments with conventional medicine, promoting personalised patient-centred care, alongside contributions to regulation and professional development. 
Regulation and Professional Recognition in South Africa
Under the Allied Health Professions Act (Act 63 of 1984), the AHPCSA (regulated under the Depatment of Health) is responsible for regulating various CAM and TM professions in South Africa. These include Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Phytotherapy, Therapeutic Aromatherapy, Therapeutic Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Reflexology and Unani-Tibb. These professions represent a unique and protected niche within South Africa’s healthcare landscape. However, despite the legal recognition of these disciplines, there are limited training programs in South Africa that contribute to the education and professional registration of complementary health science practitioners.
The Role of the School of Natural Medicine
The University of the Western Cape is one of the few institutions in South Africa dedicated to the education, research, and professional development of practitioners in complementary health sciences. The SoNM plays a central role in integrating health science knowledge, traditional healing systems, holistic patient care, sustainability, and evidence-based practice, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for clinical practice, policy development, and research at regional, national, and global levels.
Future Programmes at the School of Natural Medicine
The SoNM is currently undergoing a curriculum re-structuring process, with future programs pending approval. Planned developments include the introduction of a Professional Bachelor’s degree, Master of Science degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas, and PhD programs. These new qualifications aim to enhance the academic and professional pathways for natural medicine practitioners while aligning with the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. Further information on these programs will be made available following the necessary institutional, statutory body, and government accreditations."

The Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Children, Families and Society (CISCFS) is an interdisciplinary centre that aims to advance knowledge production and critically engaged scholarship on children, families, and society. Specifically, the CISCFS aims to provide a holistic understanding of the interplay between the South African family (and its members) and the diverse contexts and societal structures wherein it is located to strengthen families for family well-being. To this end, we apply evidence-based and participatory practices in collaboration with partners and stakeholders, translating knowledge to practice, which are embedded within the realities of children, families and society.
For more than 10 years, the focus of Child and Family Studies has been to establish a critical mass in the field of family science, to build evidence for the need for guidelines and subsequent interventions. To meet this intention, CISCFS has partnered both locally and internationally.
At a local level, CISCFS has, and continues, to partner with community-based organisations such as The Parent Centre, Mfesane, ELRU and the NOVA Institute. Government remains a partner as Local Government (The City of Cape Town and Saldanha Bay Municipality), Western Cape Provincial Government (Department of Social Development and Department of Health), Northern Cape Provincial Government (Department of Social Development). At an international level, CFS has partnered with the University of Missouri (USA, centred on hookah use in the family and identity of Coloured people), KU Leuven (Belgium, directed at psychological well-being, the parent-child relationship and Self-Determination Theory), the University of Huddersfield (UK, focusing on ECD and Higher Education), the University of Maastricht (Netherlands, developing an intervention for hookah pipe use), Australia (research on developing responsible individuals and families linked to a local NGO), as well as a Brazil/Cuba/UK ECD Consortium and Africa Consortium (Strengthening Capacity in Parenting), has raised the profile and increased awareness of the nature of the work conducted in and by CISCFS.
CISCFS, over 15 years, has produced more than 200 peer reviewed articles in national and international journals; two books and 16 book chapters; conference presentations both locally and internationally; has hosted its first family strengthening conference on parenting interventions in collaboration with Parenting in Africa Network (May 2017); and has hosted seminars and workshops on family strengthening and building partnerships. The aforementioned publications have been cited internationally and are used to enhance the teaching in CISCFS by including South African perspectives on family, and contextual, cultural perspectives. These publications have also afforded capacity strengthening with other colleagues in the faculty through writing for publication and co-authoring. Honing skills in research methodology has also been foregrounded with training on how to conduct systematic and scoping reviews. 
Vision and Mission
The vision of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies of Children, Families and Society is to harness multi-faceted communities to produce knowledge and skills through engaged scholarship, which is contextually relevant, responsive and transformative to ultimately strengthen and benefit the health and well-being of individuals, families, communities and societies
The mission of the Centre is to co-create and advance knowledge, skills and capacities. We apply evidence-based, innovative and participatory practices through multi-faceted communities, translating knowledge which is embedded within the realities of children, families and society."

About 
The Law Clinic has always had the reputation of being the leading clinic within the region and one of the best clinics in South Africa, due to its forward-thinking strategies within the clinical movement, offering quality legal services and its progressive faculty. The Law Clinic is a division of the Faculty of Law at the University of the Western Cape. The Clinic is an accredited Law Clinic and operates with the permission and in compliance with the rules of the Legal Practice Council.
Since its inception, the Law Clinic has operated consistently within the University’s vision and guiding principles of being of value to its students and the community it serves. The Law Clinic upholds these principles by ensuring that the need for access to justice for its indigent clientele and providing senior law students with clinical legal education and training is upheld.
The Law Clinic operates as a law practice under the supervision of a director and experienced attorneys. The Law Clinic provides free legal services to indigent and marginalised communities in the surrounding Cape Metro Region of the Western Cape. The Law Clinic through its cluster of paralegal offices, provides additional legal services and outreach programmes to the community. The clinic has increased its community outreach and is currently operating in the Fezeka and Mitchell’s Plain community criminal courts.
In respect of the educational aspect, the Legal Process course is a final year elective course and the student advisors are exposed, under close supervision by qualified attorneys, to live-client, in house clinical legal education. The “learn-by-doing” and “individual critique” method of instruction at the clinic gives students a critical frame of reference by which they can effectively evaluate their own work as well as the work of others. The Law Clinic seeks to acquaint the students with the social legal problems of our indigent clientele and to instil in them a sense of social responsibility, thus ultimately producing a better quality graduate.
The aims and objectives of the Clinic are: 
To provide legal representation and legal service to indigent people with a specific focus on gender, human rights abuses and socio-economic rights issues;
To provide senior law students with clinical legal education; 
To provide practical vocational training for candidate attorneys at the Law Clinic;
To provide legal support and legal services to cluster partners and advice offices.

Course description
Medical law is a popular and growing area of interest for health workers who must navigate and comply with the many laws governing their work. Medical litigation has become an area of concern for the Department of Health, draining the health budget and leading to dramatic increases in insurance premiums for health workers in private practice. The course coordinators, in addition to having legal qualifications, have lectured in law and medical ethics in health sciences faculties at the universities of Stellenbosch and the Witwatersrand. They are also trained in medical law.
This course will raise awareness of the legal issues that may arise in medical practice and will meet the needs of health workers for understanding the underlying principles of medical law and knowledge of key court cases in this subject area.

Four Year LLB
This is the standard LLB stream in the Faculty and can be entered into after completing matric. It is currently the largest stream in terms of student numbers. Students in this stream mostly do law subjects, apart from in the first year when non-legal electives can be chosen from modules hosted by other faculties. The purpose of this programme is to prepare students for a career in law, such as an attorney, an advocate, a prosecutor, a legal advisor, or an academic. 
Five Year LLB
This stream can be entered into after completing matric. Students are allocated to this stream on the basis of the Faculty's selection criteria. This programme is known as the Foundation Programme or Extended Curriculum Programme (ECP). The only difference compared to the four year LLB is that the first year of the 4 year LLB programme is completed over two years. 
Two Year LLB
This stream can be entered into after having completed a BA (law) or B Com (law) degree, and having obtained sufficient credits that can count towards the LLB degree. Students can be given credit (totalling not more than 50% of the credits for the LLB) for modules completed in the BA (law) or B Com (law) degrees. Students then complete the four year LLB over two years. 
Three Year LLB
This stream can be entered into after having completed a Bachelor’s degree without law subjects, and having obtained sufficient credits that can count towards the LLB degree. Students can be given credit (totalling no more than 60 credits for the LLB) for modules completed in the first Bachelor’s degree. Students then complete the four year LLB over three years. 
BA (Law)
This is a three-year programme where students complete selected modules from the first three years of the LLB programme alongside subjects from other faculties. Thereafter a student can register for the LLB programme at level three and complete the LLB in two years. The aim is to provide students with a broader academic background for a future career in law, or for a career outside of the legal field where legal knowledge is an essential requirement. 
BCom (Law)
This is a three-year programme where students complete selected modules from the first three years of the LLB programme alongside subjects from the EMS Faculty. Thereafter a student can register for the LLB programme at level three and complete the LLB in two years. The purpose of this programme is to provide students with a broad formative education with various career options, specifically in the corporate world.

Niche Area 
Dietetics is a health profession in which the science of nutrition is applied to the management of individuals or communities in states of health and disease. 
The Department of Occupational Therapy at the University of the Western Cape was established around 1984. It is a leading academic entity that offers quality undergraduate and postgraduate occupational therapy education programmes. Our graduates are competent, reflective practitioners who are able to practice at all levels of the health care system. 
The department has a proud history of community engagement and professional development of physiotherapists from all over the African continent and has graduated physiotherapists from Honours to PhD all over Africa. 
Psychology is the scientific study of human emotion, cognition, and behaviour. Careers in psychology can be very rewarding and fulfilling, albeit challenging. Being allowed entry into the private and often vulnerable sides of others, is a privilege, and the opportunity to contribute to the healing and growth of others, makes for a meaningful life experience. 
We at the Department of Social Work at the University of the Western Cape are committed to excellence in Social work education, practice and research. 
The Department of Sport, Recreation and Exercise Science (SRES) provides students with the necessary academic and professional skills to promote health through participation in sport, recreation and physical activities. 
The CISCFS is an interdisciplinary entity that aims to advance knowledge production and critically engaged scholarship on children, families, and society. 
Under the Allied Health Professions Act (Act 63 of 1984), the AHPCSA (regulated under the Department of Health) is responsible for regulating various CAM and TM professions in South Africa. These include Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, Chiropractic, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Phytotherapy, Therapeutic Aromatherapy, Therapeutic Massage Therapy, Therapeutic Reflexology and Unani-Tibb. These professions represent a unique and protected niche within South Africa’s healthcare landscape. However, despite the legal recognition of these disciplines, there are limited training programs in South Africa that contribute to the education and professional registration of complementary health science practitioners.
The SoNM is currently undergoing a curriculum re-structuring process, with future programs pending approval. Planned developments include the introduction of a Professional Bachelor’s degree, Master of Science degrees, Postgraduate Diplomas, and PhD programs. These new qualifications aim to enhance the academic and professional pathways for natural medicine practitioners while aligning with the evolving needs of the healthcare sector. Further information on these programs will be made available following the necessary institutional, statutory body, and government accreditations. 
The School of Nursing at the University of the Western Cape is located in the Belville Campus in the Community and Health Science Faculty. The school offers both undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education programmes. 
Established in 1993, the School of Public Health is unique in many respects both in South Africa and
in the continent. 
The Interprofessional Education Unit's (IPEU) vision is to be leaders in IPE for scholarship, healthcare and communities.
This is supported by the IPEU's mission: to facilitate interprofessional education and collaborative practice, collaborative research and scholarship, and community engagement, in an ever-changing higher education and healthcare environment.

Global assessments present a disconcerting view of the condition of the environment, a condition that is likely to have a severe impact on the survival of humankind. Humankind is rapidly transgressing existing planetary boundaries. This apocalyptic nightmare is, however, not equally applicable to everyone, as the poorest and most vulnerable will be harder hit by environmental degradation than others. Environmental degradation will exacerbate inequity and inequality. Hence, the environmental crisis is closely associated with issues of equity and justice.
This crisis raises questions about the adequacy of law as a mechanism to counter global environmental degradation. It seems that environmental law is fraught with structural shortcomings that necessitate an innovative, and perhaps radical, revision of its tenets in order to address a looming environmental crisis. The specific nature of global environmental challenges and the dire consequences of phenomena such as climate change necessitate the rapid and flexible development of law.
Against this backdrop, the Global Environmental Law (GEL) research niche aims to foster legal research and innovation to enhance the ways that global environmental law responds to the environmental crisis. The niche area pursues its objectives through, inter alia:
organising annual international seminars on critical topics;
hosting leading international scholars;
postgraduate supervision;
academic publications; and
International collaboration.

ECR Spotlight – Kathryn van Boom
ECR Spotlight is an interview series featuring early-career researchers (ECRs) from the Journal of Experimental Biology, promoting the diversity of ECRs and the variety of animals and physiological systems studied. Kathryn van Boom, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of the Western Cape, authored the paper ""Does sex matter in the cheetah? Insights into the skeletal muscle of the fastest land animal."" Her research investigates physiological responses to stressors such as disease, diet, and exercise, focusing on skeletal muscle. Kathryn's passion for biology began in childhood and continued through her education, culminating in a PhD that explored the metabolism of captive cheetahs.
Kathryn’s scientific journey includes a BSc in Human Physiology and Biochemistry, followed by an MSc in Exercise Science at the University of Cape Town, where she studied the skeletal muscle of domestic dogs. Her PhD at the University of Pretoria used metabolomics to study glycine supplementation in cheetahs, yielding important data for their conservation. Her postdoctoral research now focuses on identifying markers for insulin resistance and diabetes in humans. Kathryn enjoys the challenges and collaborations of research, valuing the freedom to explore and the insights gained from her work. Her favourite research tool is the fluorescence microscope, essential for investigating muscle structure and proteins, and her favourite animal is the cheetah, reflecting her dedication to their conservation.

Awarded a R1M research grant by the Water Research Commission (WRC) - Dr Elzaan Booysen
Dr Elzaan Booysen is a post doctoral fellow in my group and has just been awarded a R1M research grant by the Water Research Commission (WRC). 
Her application is a follow up project that I led in 2022-2024, together with researchers in IMBM (Drs Van Zyl and Burger) and in collaboration with the South African biotech company BioDX and leading expert Prof Gideon Wolfaardt at Stellenbosch University and the CSIR. 
Dr Booysen was the lead researcher on the project. Phase 1 yielded very promising results towards improved anti-biofilm activity in industrial wastewater when the commercially and industry used biocide is co-formulated with the novel compound that we have patented. To take this from lab-scale to pilot scale (phase 2), Dr Elzaan Booysen submitted a concept note application to the WRC, which was approved and she was invited to submit a full proposal in 2024. We received the excellent news a couple of weeks ago that her project has been awarded. 
This represents one of very few opportunities that postdoctoral fellows have to initiate projects as the lead PI and is an excellent example that demonstrates genuine commitment to supporting emerging researchers- both from the institutional perspective (IMBM is an enabling environment that creates and supports opportunities for early career staff) and from the funder- a wonderful recipe for success."

Why study pharmacy? 
Pharmacists play meaningful roles in the healthcare of people. They do this through emphasis on correct and rational use of medicines and related products.
Pharmacists remain in high demand in the public and private sectors. The corporate part is expanding and the demand for pharmacists continues. This applies to South Africa and other countries of the world. 
What is the duration of the curriculum?
The curriculum extends over four years. After obtaining the Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) degree, an internship of one year (in community, hospital or industry) or two years (academic) ensues. This is followed by a compulsory year of community service in the public hospital sector as a fully-fledged pharmacist. 
Career opportunities with a BPharm degree
Community Pharmacy – Pharmacists play key roles in communities. They dispense medicines, counsel patients on correct and rational use of medication, healthcare products and cosmetics, provide advice on health matters, perform diagnostic screening procedures and refer to other health care workers when there are indications for that. Often pharmacists assume positions of leadership in communities they serve. 
Hospital Pharmacy – Pharmacists in this setting dispense medicines and counsel patients. They may also be involved in small-scale manufacture of specialised medicines such as radio-active pharmaceuticals, total parenteral nutrition preparations and injectables. The management of drug supplies is an important facet in this setting. 
Industrial Pharmacy – An industrial pharmacist is involved in the manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, registration and marketing of all types of medicines whether in liquid, semisolid and solid forms including tablets, suppositories, injections and syrups. They usually assume supervisory or other leadership positions in this arena. 
Academic Pharmacy – This is for pharmacists interested in pursuing careers in academia. This involves teaching and training of university students, pursuing research interests of the individual, the institution and the profession, publications of completed research projects in accredited journals and presentations at conferences of such work. All this for the development and progress of the knowledge base and in this way, contributing to the advancement of the pharmacy profession. 
Other career options are: 
The detailing of medicines to prescribers and dispensers thereof on behalf of pharmaceutical companies by pharmaceutical representatives 
The assistance in drug clinical trials as clinical research associates 
Consultants to medical aids and other pharmaceutical institutions and businesses
Opportunities also exist in the field of regulatory and professional organisations associated with pharmacy, such as the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) and The Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa.
Pharmacists may also be usefully employed in the fields of cosmetics, food and beverage companies in manufacturing and marketing. 
Skills acquired:
Sound communication and writing skills 
Interpersonal skills 
Critical thinking abilities 
Sound laboratory techniques 
A BPharm degree at any South African University does not necessarily entitle one to register as a pharmacist in South Africa. A qualified person with a BPharm degree is only permitted to work as a pharmacist upon registration with the South African Pharmacy Council.
This requirement is supported by legislation and regulations promulgated as part of the national Department of Health. Foreign Workforce management is through arrangements by SADC and other bilateral agreements."

The Department of Science and Innovation identified nanoscience as an important new field that South Africa needs to develop. As such, they introduced a dedicated postgraduate programme for training in nanoscience and nanotechnology. 
This programme also marks the introduction of a new system of collaboration between universities, where four South African universities are simultaneously presenting the same Master's degree. Since 2012 a Master's programme in nanoscience and nanotechnology has been offered in collaboration with the University of Johannesburg (UJ), Nelson Mandela University (NMU), the University of the Free State (UFS) and the University of the Western Cape (UWC). 
The study of nanomaterials, nanoscience and nanotechnology exists at the overlap between biology, chemistry and physics, students from all these fields will register for the same degree - a new concept in advanced research in South Africa.
The programme comprises three aspects: 
introductory courses in the wider aspects of nanoscience
courses in advanced nanoscience studies in the respective study fields

Welcome to The Proteomics Unit
What is Proteomics?
Proteomics is the term that describes a multitude of tools and expertise used primarily to profile and identify proteins of interest in any organism at a large scale. Proteins of interests include biomarkers for certain diseases or physiological/developmental status. For example, one could use proteomics to investigate effects of pathogens on organ protein expression levels and patterns.
This information could be used to identify targets/strategies for the improvement of pathogen resistance by plants and animals. 
In addition to current 2D PAGE, Imaging, Picking and MALDI-TOF MS Facilities: 
Multi-purpose Tandem Mass Spectrometry workstation 
Integrated High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
Sample handling robotics for high throughput workflow 
Mass measurements for various post-translational modifications in specific amino acid residues, including phosphorylation and glycosylation. 
The system also offers MALDI ""histoproteome"" imaging for in situ profiling of intact proteins in plant and animal tissues. 
Metabolite ID and profiling? MALDI microbe bio-typing

We at the Department of Social Service Professions at the University of the Western Cape are committed to excellence in Social work education, practice and research. We believe in justice, gender equity, human diversity and citizenship for all. We shall continue to strive and pursue these values through our curriculum at UWC that respond to the impulse of our nation and change communities locally. 
Message from the Head of Department
The Department of Social Service Professions embraces the collaboration of all the social service professions to ensure holistic wellbeing for individuals, families, groups, and communities. As such, the department offers two-degree programmes, namely the Bachelor of Social Work and the Bachelor of Community Development. 
Working together, we believe that the social service professions can make a valuable contribution to promote social change and development, to stimulate social cohesion, and to work towards social justice. Through our interdisciplinary approach, we strive to build national and international collaborations that aim to operationalise principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and a respect and celebration of diversity. 
We also offer Master's of Social Work and Doctor of Social Work postgraduate programmes.
Our learning and teaching philosophy places emphasis on experiential learning where students can develop knowledge, understanding and skills to become active change agents in society. We believe in student participation, interactive learning experiences, and the acknowledgement that students bring valuable prior knowledge and life experiences to the classroom. 
The Department of Social Service Professions commits itself to the professional and personal development of students to the benefit of society. We therefore place emphasis on the following:
The development of scholarship through an inquiry-focused approach to learning and teaching. Our learning and teaching practices are aimed at the development of scholars who will have a critical attitude towards knowledge. We place much emphasis on ethical and socially responsive practices.
The encouragement of critical citizenship that is aimed at collaborative relationships that result in networks where social justice can guide processes of positive and sustainable transformation and change. 
The encouragement of lifelong learning through reflective practices that critically explore what is needed for the social service professions to respond to current and contextual realities, and to search for new knowledge and skills to respond effectively. In this way, scholars can work independently and collaboratively. 
The development of creative and collaborative problem-solving skills where disciplines work together to find innovative solutions that can contribute to the social good. We acknowledge the value of diversity where many viewpoints can contribute to finding innovative solutions for the complex socio-economic challenges in a rapidly changing environment.

Research Data Management (RDM) is the process of collecting, organising, storing, sharing and preserving research data throughout the lifecycle of a research project. Data management practices are applied using a number of mechanisms including the use of Institutional Research Data Repositories, developing Data Management Plans (DMPs) and the application of the F.A.I.R. principles of research data.
The secure storage, archiving and sharing of research data has become a mandatory requirement by institutions, funders and publishers. UWC research data sets and associated documents may be stored securely and shared via the UWC data repositories. To find out more consult the Guide to Research Data Management."
https://www.uwc.ac.za/campus-life/resources/research-impact/online-researcher-visibility,"Online Researcher Visibility | UWC
The main reason for setting up a profile is as a way to have all your publications listed in the one place. This makes it easy for others to easily identify your work. It is also useful for author disambiguation purposes – different databases display author names differently, and if you have a common name it can be difficult for others to easily identify your work. Researcher and author profiles are generated automatically by publishers using various algorithms. Researchers can also create and manage their own profiles using various online tools. It is important to note that these researcher created profiles need to be kept up-to-date.
For more information consult the Guide to Researcher Visibility and Online Profiles."

Head of Unit
Position: Manager 
Minnelise Levendal is currently the manager of the UWC Cape Flats Nature Reserve Unit, which includes the Indigenous Nursery and Environmental Education Centre, since March 2023.
She completed her BSc (Education) and BSc Honours degree at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and then her MSc in Botany at the University of Stellenbosch. Her dissertation focussed on seasonal photosynthetic temperature responses and changes in 13C under varying temperature regimes in leaf-succulent and drought-deciduous shrubs from the Succulent Karoo. After completing her Honours degree, she lectured Mycology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) in 1995. She then lectured Botany to second year students at the UWC in 1996.
After completing her Masters Degree in 1999, she was selected as one of 20 students from third world countries to attend a course on desertification in 1999 sponsored by the Shalom Programme at the Ramon Science Center, Sede Boqer, Mitrani Department of Desert Ecology, Bengurion University of the Negev, Israel. After successfully completing the one-month course, she worked at the said institution as a research assistant for two months. The research she conducted led to an article that was published in the Journal of Arid Environments in 2004[1].
Minnelise was then appointed as an Environmental Officer at the Western Cape Department of Environmental Affairs and Development Planning (DEA&DP). Her work included assessing and issuing Environmental Decisions on Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), Basic Assessments (BAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) to ensure that environmental issues are adequately addressed in development applications. At DEA&DP she also worked in the Biodiversity unit to promote the mainstreaming of biodiversity into environmental decision-making, policies and planning.
Before joining the UWC Nature Reserve Unit, Minnelise worked as a senior Environmental Assessment Practitioner (EAP) in the Environmental Management Services (EMS) Group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Stellenbosch. She managed various large scale EIAs and BAs, with a strong focus on renewable energy projects in South Africa, including wind and solar. At the CSIR Minnelise also managed the Special Needs and Skills Development Programme from 2016-2018, which was funded and undertaken on behalf the national Department of Environmental Affairs. The aim of the programme was to assist people, community members or community groups with special needs by conducting Environmental Assessments to obtain Environmental Authorisation for their small-scale projects (mostly agriculture). Another aim of the programme was to enhance human capital development by appointing, training and mentoring interns who have recently graduated from a university or a Technicon to development the necessary skills and experience in environmental management and assessment as part of the programme. This project received the CSIR Award for best Human Capital Development in 2015.

The Cape Flats Nature Reserve is a hidden gem in the heart of an urban area. Despite the location, 119 species have been recorded with the list growing each year. 
The 34ha reserve has a seasonal wetland and two vegetation types; endangered Cape Flats Dune Strandveld and critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. This vegetative combination lends to a unique habitat to attract wildlife. The reserve provides a safe bird watching experience while you absorb your senses in nature. 
A variety of birds can be seen ranging from the pretty Bee-eater and Paradise flycatcher to interesting LBJs like the Bar-throated apalis and Brown-backed honeybird. You might even be lucky enough to spot a nesting Fiery-necked nightjar or Spotted eagle-owl. 
We have a downloadable checklist below for the avid birder and a photographic checklist for the beginner birder. We rely on you to continue growing our list, so should you spot anything of interest or an addition to the list, please let us know by emailing Laurenda van Bread on Lvanbreda@uwc.ac.za.

The Cape Flats Nature Reserve’s annual Faunal Survey is a skills training activity for conservation biology students, exposing them to various monitoring techniques that they would need in their studies, future research and careers. 
UWC staff, students, future students and outside expertise in the biodiversity field help make this event fun and successful. The survey happens over a weekend in October, at night and during the day. 
We do fieldwork and carry out monitoring techniques for different plant and animal species. It is enjoyable hard work, interesting long hours, filled with enthusiastic participants having fun during this learning process. 
Besides the training exercise, all the nature reserve species lists get updated, therefore your participation and contribution are highly valued towards the greater good of conservation.

Studies show that students who learn outdoors can tackle their subjects with enhanced motivation, creativity and competence, and may even strengthen their peer relationships in the process.
Outdoor learning also encourages learners to understand the interplay and relationship between the different curriculum areas. This awareness promotes lifelong learning and develops critical thinking skills. 
A fun learning environment also helps students focus once they are back in the classroom and alleviates stress by simply being in the outdoors. A simple change of scenery and the fresh outdoor air can make the world of difference. 
Outdoor learning can also greatly assist students who experience learning difficulties in the structured classroom. Outdoor learning experiences help to increase student motivation, whilst building their confidence and in turn improving student behaviour.
The concept of Photo Walks officially started in May 2016 with the intention of getting staff and students into the reserve to enjoy nature in the comfort of a group. 
It is a short guided walk with information provided about the reserve and their chosen photographic interest. 
All photographs assist by updating the photographic library and species lists with sometimes exciting discoveries of previously unrecorded species. 
Twenty five fauna and flora species were added to the species list between 2014 and 2018; seven of which came from Photo Walks. Even taking photographs of you and your friends having fun in nature helps promote the nature reserve as a place of interest. 
These walks happen every Thursday between 1pm and 2pm. Staff, students and non UWC members are welcome. All that is needed is your enthusiasm and a camera/cell phone camera to partake in the fun. 
For bookings: contact Laurenda van Breda at lvanbreda@uwc.ac.za.
The UWC Nature Reserve Unit supports the academic programmes of the university through field work, practical teaching and research guidance. Through our volunteer programme, students have the opportunity to gain required skills and practical experience in Biodiversity, Conservation, Horticulture and Environmental Education.

How is the global and national food system changing, and how does this affect the sustainability, availability, access and attributes of food?
Who are the ‘food insecure’, where are they located, what are their choices, strategies and opportunities when seeking food security, health, and well-being? And how do these change in response to the changing food system?
What policies, technologies, interventions and products enable access to affordable and nutritious food in ecological, economic, social and politically sustainable ways?"

Food security and nutrition are imperative for human survival with dignity. Achieving food security must take into account economic vitality, social justice, human and environmental health.
Our goal is to undertake research, capacity building and dissemination activities to promote a sustainable food system that brings about food security for poor, vulnerable and marginal populations.
Our research is transdisciplinary, and involves using innovative methodologies for high-impact science through understanding and taking action on complex societal problems. We adopt a partnership approach to the organisation of our activities by building purposeful, strategic relationships for the co-design and co-ownership of research problems, methodologies and solutions.
Through a transformative agenda, we provide leadership, evidence for decision making and critique of policies and programmes aimed at reducing food insecurity. Our comprehensive, systematic approach to development recognises the underlying causes of food insecurity such as poverty, unemployment and inequality."

About the Chair in Entrepreneurship in Higher Education and the niche area
Professor Chux Gervase Iwu has a multidisciplinary background that encompasses degrees in Library Studies, Industrial and Organisational Psychology, Human Resources Management, and an advanced diploma in Management. Prof Iwu sits on the advisory/editorial boards of the Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Emerging Economies (JEIEE) published by SAGE, the forthcoming Palgrave Macmillan Encyclopedia of Entrepreneurship, the Center for Entrepreneurship Rapid Incubator (CfERI) of False Bay College, among many others. He served as head of the department of entrepreneurship at another university where he led a team that curriculated various entrepreneurship programmes.
Prof Iwu researches the broad area of socioeconomic issues in emerging economies. A common socioeconomic problem in Africa is graduate unemployment. South Africa struggles with that as well resulting in the need for students to become economically active during and after their studies and subsequently pursue self-employment instead of paid employment. The university is an integral part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Entrepreneurship development in South Africa’s higher education is, therefore, a crucial agenda.
South Africa’s National Development Plan (2030) makes a fervent call for the reduction of poverty and inequality and further advises that to achieve those, there is a need to broaden opportunity and employment through economic inclusion, education, and skills, and thereby promoting mutual respect and inclusiveness as enshrined in the constitution. A further justification is drawn from the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, which hopes to achieve broad-based, and sustainable economic growth by promoting policies that encourage entrepreneurship and consequently job creation.
The goal of the Chair is to realise productive entrepreneurship through research that leads to accelerated interest in entrepreneurship among students. Reaching a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students, faculty, and the wider university community is linked to the university’s mission and goals, which promote entrepreneurial teaching, research, and community engagement. In achieving this goal, entrepreneurship research should uncover elements that support entrepreneurial uptake, and how these elements are embeddable in the curricula of business and non-business-related programs in South African institutions of higher learning. Research should also focus on ways to make entrepreneurship education an attractive field of study and how entrepreneurial projects and outcomes translate to improved standards of living for communities.
Realising productive entrepreneurship through higher education will therefore require building research capacity in the field of entrepreneurship and proffering ways to inculcate entrepreneurship in students across faculties. This will lead to a better understanding of the entrepreneurial ecosystem and ways to contribute to it and provide academic leadership of entrepreneurship-related activities within the University of the Western Cape. This suggests that a chair of entrepreneurship is instructive to meaningfully achieve entrepreneurial outcomes. 
Entrepreneurship Niche area’s link to SDGs
While this niche area can find a home in any of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is closely associated with goals #1 (No Poverty), #4 (Quality Education), #8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and #10 (Reduced Inequalities).
The UN considers quality education and sustainable economic growth crucial for developing economies’ advancement. The essence of quality education is that it broadens one’s chances of attaining decent work opportunities which in turn advance the economic growth of a nation. Achieving this requires the participation of various stakeholders. An important stakeholder here is the university or college.
There is a link between joblessness, inequality, and poverty in South Africa. The latest figures for unemployment in South Africa depict the dismal struggle to curb the triple threat of poverty, inequality, and unemployment. Entrepreneurs have played important roles in reducing poverty, inequality, and unemployment. The outcome of entrepreneurial initiatives is found in small, medium, and micro businesses and so over the years, small, medium, and micro businesses have gained fame as noteworthy contributors to the economy of any nation.
To emphasise its national significance, the South African Department of Small Business Development coordinates, develops, and promotes entrepreneurship as a component of its effort to boost development and reduce poverty by creating employment opportunities. Universities, as part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, ought to be involved in the crusade to effectively motivate and prepare youth for entrepreneurship. Education is key to accelerating economic growth. Entrepreneurship development in higher education will increase entrepreneurial participation, and employment opportunities and decrease poverty, inequality, and unemployment. This is perhaps among the many reasons why creating an enabling environment and improving higher education curricula with content that advances an interest in entrepreneurship is important."

Journal of Entrepreneurial Innovations (JEI)
About the Journal
The Journal of Entrepreneurial Innovations (JEI) launched in March 2020, is a free-access, free to publish online journal that is published by the Department of Management and Entrepreneurship at the University of the Western Cape. The JEI specialises in publishing research and analyses pertaining to entrepreneurship trends and particularly innovations in the small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs).
By definition, entrepreneurship is a cross-disciplinary concept; as such, JEI encourages authors to position their research from multi- and inter-disciplinary perspectives. JEI seeks to enhance scholastic discourse in the numerous disciplines that affect SMMEs and entrepreneurship. This includes accounting, finance, general management, leadership, microfinance, entrepreneurship, small business management, management information systems, business law, marketing, project management, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, and ethics, among others. Above all, the journal seeks to provide greater dissemination of information and knowledge in these disciplines.
JEI’s publication policy
JEI is a double blind peer-reviewed journal that is published as an open-access online journal. The journal has Editorial board members who are academic experts, who share our mission in making sure that JEI publishes good quality papers.
The journal publishes one volume constituting three issues (March, July, October) once a year. The journal has published 3 volumes since inception.
The types of papers published include: 
Research papers: these report on empirical scientific studies that provide new insights into theory, practice as well as methodologies applied to reach and verify findings of important concerns within emerging markets. Although there are no strict length requirements that are stipulated for this type of publications, research papers usually range from 5, 000 words to 7, 000 words (approx. 7 - 12 manuscript pages). JEI imposes a word limit of 10, 000 words per manuscript.
Conceptual papers: conceptual papers (i.e., ideas, concepts, or frameworks not yet empirically tested) are also encouraged. Submissions of this nature often includes the examination of novel theories, concepts, and ideas. The length of conceptual papers usually does not vary from research papers and can range from 5, 000 words to 7, 000 words (approx. 7 - 12 manuscript pages).
Reviews: the journal also seeks to publish reviews of various publications including books, articles, and other contemporary phenomena. Generally, reviews are shorter in length, at approximately 2 to 4 manuscript pages.
Technical Reports: are usually written for a non-academic audience such as business managers and practitioners. The emphasis of technical reports is to encourage the dissemination of practical knowledge, which is of great importance but rarely published. These publications typically range from 2 to 5 pages.
Case studies: these are specific in-depth analyses of individual phenomena, businesses, or events. Case studies allow for a detailed introspection into a single phenomenon that facilitates problem solving.
Conference Special Issues: in certain instances, approved conference proceedings will be published in the Journal of Entrepreneurial Innovations as a Special Issue. All papers presented at such conferences will be published after going through the normal (double-blind) review process.
Doctoral proposals: as a means to promote the publication of research and scientific material of new and upcoming scholars, JEI encourages doctoral students to publish their research proposals. This is a unique offering for PhD students; this is particularly true given that PhD candidates in the developing world have limited research experience and not too many options to publish their work, this journal provides this platform as a research mentorship and training platform.

Although the Politics and Urban Research Group (PUG) is relatively new, the team has been highly productive, both in producing outputs and securing research grants. PUG Research leads and participates in numerous projects with partners across the world. The following are four of PUG's current projects:
Interrogating Urban Crisis Representation and Response
Funder: British Academy
Partners: University of Sheffield, University of Cambridge, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali
Duration: 2023-2024
Aim: This study explores local perspectives of urban crisis representation and response across four ‘disorderly’ urban areas (two in South Africa and two in Colombia). Through privileging the lived experiences of marginalised populations and employing a novel comparative storytelling methodology, the project interrogates the relationship between crisis framings and ensuing responses, alongside the notion of crisis itself, in support of more effective urban crisis response.
Participedia: Participatory democracy
Funder: Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council
Partners: McMaster University
Duration: 2021-2025
Aim: Participedia aims to promote global cross-sectoral knowledge that supports democratic innovation and resilience.
Governing the Just Urban Transition (GoJUT)
Funder: National Research Foundation
Partners: Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO), University of Cambridge, University of Sheffield, Cardiff University
Duration: 2024-2026
Aim: This interdisciplinary project focuses on the coping strategies that businesses in low-income areas of Johannesburg and Cape Town use to secure water and energy.
African Hub for Human Rights
Funders: Ford Foundation and University of York
Duration: 2024-2026
Aim: Universities have the potential to play a multifaceted role in relation to the protection of human rights. The project aims to support African Human Rights Defenders and network building.

A key problem that the Politics and Urban Research Group (PUG) addresses is the vulnerability of marginalised communities, which stems from governance systems that often fail them. By focusing on the intersection between formal and informal governance, we aim to shed light on why governance is not functioning as it should, with an emphasis on the poor interaction between these systems.
Our work is timely, given the emerging relevance of hybrid governance, which seeks to understand these dynamics both empirically and conceptually. PUG’s approach is grounded in a human rights lens, emphasising the importance of connecting these governance debates to broader issues of social justice.
As an interdisciplinary space, PUG integrates diverse methodologies and collaborates beyond academia, promoting epistemic justice and challenging power imbalances in knowledge production. Many of the concepts central to governance are defined in the Global North, but PUG’s research bridges these with local, South African contexts, ensuring that governance debates are relevant to the lived realities of vulnerable communities.
Our work is grounded in pushing boundaries through innovative theorisation, methodology, and diverse collaborations that bridge voices between vulnerable groups and power holders. In doing so, we contribute to rethinking how universities can be sites of transformative knowledge production and help them shift toward greater social responsiveness and relevance, in line with UWC’s strategic goals.
PUG seeks to produce impactful research that leads to material change, across various levels. We interrogate systems of governance, university structures, funding models, and publishing practices, all with the aim of fostering attitude, value, and worldview shifts that prioritise equity and activism."

Postgraduate Diploma in Language Practice
APPLY NOW
What is the Postgraduate Diploma in Language Practice about?
The Postgraduate Diploma in Language Practice combines professional and applied language skills for the purpose of advanced communication skills training, with professional development, to enhance students’ knowledge of various language practice professions, such as translation and interpreting, literary translation and lexicography. The content provides a practical and theoretical foundation within a rigorous academic framework that builds a high-level foundation training to enable students to succeed as professional language practitioners and /or engage in further research. More specifically, it gives insights at a practical level into the various aspects of a professional language practice career (e.g. translation and interpreting, literacy translation, lexicography), and at an academic level into the processes and principles that should inform language practice professions.
Outcomes of the programme
At end of the programme the student will have the ability to: 
Demonstrate an understanding of relevant theories of language, society and power, as they relate to the field of language practice through synthesising different theoretical sources and applying these to selected case studies.
Synthesise and critically evaluate different theories and frameworks as they relate to selected language practice professions, with a particular focus on the impact of digital technologies and practices;
Demonstrate the ability to facilitate multilingual and cross-cultural communication in a range of professional contexts, by applying relevant theory to selected case studies;
Critically evaluate and justify the choice of different language practice approaches based on a critical understanding of relevant linguistic and language practice theory in a digital era;
Critically evaluate and revise to a professional standard, different language practice methodologies and tools, as employed in a range of selected language practice professions e.g. translating and editing, literary translation, lexicography;
Conduct independent research into specialised subject areas relating to selected language practice professions in a digital era.

Sindiwe Magona was born on 27 August 1943, in the village of Gungululu in rural Eastern Cape (formerly Transkei). The first born of eight children, Magona earned her secondary and undergraduate education by correspondence, and later won a scholarship to study for her Master’s Degree in Social Work at Columbia University in the United States of America. Magona is one of many internationally prominent South African writers whose work is informed by her experience of impoverishment, femininity, resistance to subjugation and being a domestic worker. She traversed South Africa’s racially-defined socio-cultural-economic spaces while simultaneously being a mother, wife and community leader in a township. These interlaced themes and realities are pronounced throughout her literary career.
A former primary school teacher and civil servant, she is a prolific author who has produced nine books, among them an autobiographical work, a collection of short stories, novellas and an anthology of poetry.
She has produced various plays and continues to lecture and deliver key addresses at universities and conferences, both locally and internationally. Until her retirement in 2003, she contributed immeasurably in various capacities to the work of the United Nations (UN), an organisation she served for 20 years.
Even in retirement, she continues to pen literary works, to initiate writers’ conferences, lead women’s rights advocacy groups and write children’s educational books. Among her internationally acclaimed works are Beauty’s Gift; Living, Loving, and Lying Awake at Night; To My Children’s Children; Teach Yourself Xhosa; and Push-Push and Other Stories. Her plays include I Promised Myself a Fabulous Middle-Age and Vukani.
Magona is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Molteno Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement for her role in promoting isiXhosa, the Permio Grinzane Terre D’Otrantro, and the Department of Arts and Culture Literary Lifetime Achievement Award (all three received in 2007); the Bronx Recognises Its Own Fiction Award in 2000; a Fellowship for Non-Fiction from the New York Foundation of the Arts; the Xhosa Heroes Award; and the UNdimande Grand Prize. The Hartwick College of New York conferred her with an honorary doctorate in 1993. She was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writer’s Prize in 2009.
She remains an accomplished motivational speaker, author, poet, playwright and story-teller in South Africa. Many of Ms Magona’s essays, short stories and poems have been anthologised. She has been published in, among other publications, the New York Times, The New Internationalist, Fair Lady, Oprah Magazine and Femina.
She is also recognised for her work in women’s issues, the plight of children and the fight against apartheid and racism. Ms Magona is the founder and Executive Director of South Africa 2033. A worker for peaceful change during the years of struggle in South Africa, she was one of the founding members of the Women’s Peace Movement in 1976.
With her inspiration and encouragement, the Gugulethu Writers’ Group meets once a month and nurtures new writers. The group has already published a collection of short stories, Umthi ngamnye unentlaka yawo, and won First Prize in the Maskew Miller Longman Story Competition in 2009.
In recognition of her literary and humanitarian contribution, the State President, Jacob G Zuma, conferred Sindiwe Magona with the Order of Ikhamanga in Bronze on 27 April 2011.

Robyn Tyler is a senior researcher in the Centre. Her research focuses on language, literacy and identity in education with a special interest in language across the curriculum in multilingual contexts. She graduated with her doctorate in 2019 from the University of Cape Town. Her thesis reported on a linguistic ethnography conducted over nine months in a township high school. It explored meaning-making by bilingual English-isiXhosa Science learners in two learning sites: the traditional classroom setting and an after-school study group. Robyn is a researcher on the CMDR project Leveraging languages for Science learning in multilingual classrooms (2020-2022) which seeks to develop best practice in multilingual Science classrooms through teaching and supervising pre-service Science teachers in multilingual methods and tracking their uptake of these in their teaching. She has seven years of high school English teaching experience in South Africa and the United Kingdom. During this time she became interested in the role of language and identity in learning beyond the language classroom, particularly for non-dominant, multilingual students, and decided to pursue postgraduate studies in language and literacy education. Robyn has taught and supervised pre-service teachers in two South African universities and is currently co-supervising two doctoral students at Ghent University, Belgium. She is also a member of the bua-lit language and literacy collective which advocates for a rich literacies approach to the education of multilingual South African children. Robyn serves on the governing body of an ex-model C primary school in Cape Town where she has led the recent school language policy reform.

Professor Christopher Stroud is a Professor of Linguistics at UWC and an affiliated Professor of Bilingual Research at the Centre for Research on Bilingualism at Stockholm University, Sweden. Before coming to UWC, he spent six years in Singapore at the National University of Singapore, Department of English Language and Literature. He has researched in Southern Africa (Mozambique and South Africa) in the fields of linguistic human rights and linguistic citizenship, colonialism and post-coloniality in constructions of multilingualism, language ideological debates, the development of Portuguese L2 varieties and mother tongue and bilingual education.
He also did research in Singapore in the areas of politics of language and literacy education and the sociolinguistics of globalisation and mobilisation; in Sweden in the fields of language loss, maintenance and revival, the metaphorical use of language in public debates (particularly, the notions of Semi-lingualism and Rinkeby Swedish), second language acquisition and bilingual language pathologies; and in Papua New Guinea with linguistic descriptions of small languages, the sociolinguistics of contact and code-switching, and emerging vernacular literacies. 
He has worked as a consultant for international organisations such as the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the South African Renewable Energy Council (SAREC) with research and capacity development at the National Institute of Education in Mozambique, and in the development and evaluation of language curricula and its implementation.
His current research interests focus on practices and ideologies of multilingualism in social and politically transforming economies in Southern Africa. For the past five years, he has been working on semiotic landscapes and consumption in the townships and informal settlements of Cape Town and exploring the potential of multilingual mobile literacies and modes of local engagement in emerging community literacies, for voice and agency in the townships of Manenberg and Khayelitsha. He is working towards a notion of linguistic/multilingual citizenship as an approach to multilingual dynamics and the politics of language.

Dr Margie Probyn is a Research Fellow in the CMDR. Her research interests are in language and education in multilingual classrooms, language and science education, language-in-education policy and practice, teacher education, literacies. Margie has experience as an English teacher in multilingual classrooms, and as a researcher and teacher educator.
Current and recent research and development projects:
1. Languaging for Learning (L4L) 2021- 24:
This research and teacher development project has been funded by the Zenex Foundation and involves a collaboration between teacher educators and researchers at UWC, UCT and Stellenbosch.
The collaboration was born of a common concern with the role of language in education in schools where learners learn through their home language in the Foundation Phase but from Grade 4 are expected to switch to English medium instruction.
The resulting challenges for teachers and learners are frequently framed in deficit terms; instead the L4L research team views the challenges as stemming from systemic failures to provide all learners with equal opportunities to learn by ignoring their home language/s as important resources for learning.
The L4L pilot programme was developed for Grade 8 and 9 English First Additional Language, Natural Sciences and Mathematics teachers in ten schools in the Western Cape Province.
The intervention aimed to equip English, Science and Mathematics to address systemic language inequalities in multilingual/EFAL classrooms so that learners have the opportunities to: 
develop the necessary literacy skills for learning and functioning in society, including in English and their home languages.
systematically engage their full linguistic repertoires, including their home languages alongside English, in order to access and engage with the curriculum content knowledge for effective learning.
The pilot intervention took the form of workshops and classroom-based support and mentoring over two years in 2022 and 2023. The classroom-based support has been a critical factor in supporting teachers as they try out new ways of working with languages in the classroom.
The research findings are currently being written up by the L4L team and the teachers involved.

2. Leveraging languages for access and equity in multilingual science classrooms 2021-2022:
This project aimed to prepare BEd science education students for teaching and learning science in multilingual classrooms and in particular for them to engage with learners’ home languages as important resources for learning: to open access to science knowledge, affirm learners’ identities and facilitate links between home and classroom.
Dr Margie Probyn and Dr Robyn Tyler from the CMDR worked on the project with Science Method lecturers from the Education Faculty, UWC: Dr Shafiek Dinie and Ms Zainoenisa Allie.
We developed and piloted a 6-week unit of work for 3rd year BEd Science Education students which was taught online in 2021.
A sample of students was tracked during their 4th year teaching practice to provide support and mentoring as they tried out multilingual approaches to teaching and learning science.
It was hoped that the research findings from this intervention would inform teacher education in the field of teaching science in multilingual contexts, and the professional development of both newly qualified and experienced science teachers to address some of the long-standing linguistic challenges facing South African learners.

https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/babylon/
Babylon focuses on the study of linguistic, cultural, and religious diversity, as characteristics of the multicultural society. They focus on interdisciplinary and collective research efforts, in an attempt to explore the limits of current disciplinary frameworks. 
Babylon also focuses on a broad range of research topics and areas, covering issues that occur at the strictly local level as well as on the global level, and creating a sound basis for comparative work and theoretical generalisation. They do so by using paradigmatic orientations towards superdiversity, complexity and mediation, with immediate contact with partners in the field. 
The paradigm is superdiversity, and their activities can be summarised as Developing superdiversity as a research paradigm; Developing superdiversity as an international focus of research in a wider and interdisciplinary body of scholarship, and Giving particular attention to the superdiverse aspects of e-culture. 
The Centre for Language, Discourse and Communication (King’s College London)
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx
The centre has a wide range of expertise in the field of Language Research. These include:
Discourse, interaction, and identity
Discourse and interaction are central to social, cultural, and institutional processes. Their research examines how identities and relations are produced in language practice, and explores theoretical, methodological, and practical implications. The four strands of research are crossing, stylisation, code-switching and mixed speech, the construction of diversity and equality in institutions, and interaction and popular culture.
Discourse, communication, and health
Their research on language and health spans oral and written discourse. It is centrally concerned with the public understanding of language in a range of health contexts, issues of social equality and access in the superdiverse society, and discursive accounts of risk and safety, and the body and mental health.
Ethnicity and language
Their work on globalisation, diaspora, ethnicity, and migration connects the empirical analysis of language and discourse to contemporary cultural theory. This includes a series of funded projects on new ethnicities, schooling and urban culture; an intergenerational study of linguistic style and proficiency in a West London diaspora community; and a study text dedicated to ethnicities and language – The Language, Ethnicity and Race Reader.
The Centre for Language, Discourse and Communication and the Department of Linguistics (UWC)
In 2011-’12, the centre established a three-year programme of staff and doctoral student exchanges with the Department of Linguistics at UWC.
The UWC Linguistics Department “is heir to a proud tradition at the University of the Western Cape of putting research and teaching at the service of the local community and its striving for equitable transformation”. 
It has been pursuing a 10-year research programme on Multilingualism in Society, and it offers a serious engagement with diversity on a day-to-day basis, as well as an acute awareness of the importance of history in understanding multilingual dynamics, social relevance and critical involvement. The centre has particular strengths in research on language and literacy in globalisation and intercultural contact, focusing on language, literacy and discourse in everyday interaction, in education, in popular culture, in new and mass media, and medical and workplace settings. There is a substantial group of staff and research students with congruent interests in both sites, and they are very well-placed to provide each other with insight into language, change and stratification in our respective locales.
The programme is supported financially by the Hilden Charitable Fund, the Principal’s Initiative Fund, the School of Social Science and Public Policy, and the Department of Education and Professional Studies.

Centre for Multilingualism in Society across the Lifespan (University of Oslo)
http://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/english/
This centre’s main goal is to generate state-of-the-art scientific knowledge on individual and societal multilingualism across the lifespan that will be at the international forefront of research and will address the challenges and potentials multilingualism poses for the individual in the family, school, other institutions, and society in general. 
Moreover, the centre shall provide research-based knowledge on multilingualism to central policymakers and stakeholders. The centre’s vision is to contribute to how society can deal with the challenges of multilingualism through increased knowledge, promoting agency for individuals in society, and a better quality of life, no matter what linguistic or social background.
To achieve a better understanding of multilingualism, and the individual and societal gains and challenges it poses, we will address the following major research questions: 
What characterises individual multilingual competence: how is it acquired, how does it change, and how is it impaired or potentially lost across the lifespan?
How do various multilingual practices emerge, how are they sustained, and how do they change across the lifespan through the social and cultural activities people engage in.
How is multilingualism in society managed across the lifespan at the group and societal level, and how do ideologies influence this management?
Centre for Research on Bilingualism (Stockholm University)

The International Consortium for Language and Superdiversity (InCoLaS) (Max Planck Institute)
http://www.mmg.mpg.de/subsites/sociolinguistic-diversities/about/
InCoLaS was formed in 2010 involving Tilburg University, King’s College London (Rampton, Harris), Birmingham University (Martin-Jones, Creese & Blackledge), Copenhagen University (Jörgensen, Madsen, Spindler-Möller, Karrebaek), UWC (Stroud, Williams), and the University of Jyväskyla (Leppänen, Westinen) as the core team; and Sydney University of Technology (Pennycook), Beijing University (Gao), University of Pennsylvania (Moore, Agha, Wortham) and Simon Fraser University (Vigouroux) as the second-line team.
InCoLaS started collaborating intensively with the Max Planck Institute for Religious and Ethnic Diversity (MPI-MMG Göttingen, Germany, director Steven Vertovec). It was incorporated into the MPI-MMG in 2012 as the Max Planck Sociolinguistic Diversity Working Group (coordinator Karel Arnaut) (see http://www.mmg.mpg.de/subsites/sociolinguistic-diversities/about/).
Since 2010, intensive synergies have led to joint (and successful) funding applications, publications, research training initiatives, sharing of student supervision as well as resources sharing. There has been intense cooperation in the context of a HERA project and SANPAD project (both successfully completed in 2012), and various project applications are currently being developed in the fields of, e.g. e-humanities, asylum-seeking, migration, and certification of skills and knowledge.
Additionally, the outspoken international dimension of the network and its activities has boosted the local research environment, enabling students and researchers to move between partner institutions. 
Max Planck Institute for Religious and Ethnic Diversity (Gottingen, Germany)
http://www.mpg.de/en
The Institute is dedicated to the multi-disciplinary study of diversity in historical and contemporary societies, particularly concerning ethnic and religious forms and dynamics. Such work entails basic empirical research aimed at theoretical development. 
Projects investigate multiple forms of diversity, how these have been shaped and defined, how they have been or could be governed, how different processes of inter-ethnic or inter-religious encounter unfold, how patterns and images of diversity change, and how relations between concepts of ethnicity and religion develop. 
Studies address migration-related contexts (in so-called migrant-sending, -transit and -receiving societies) as well as contexts long characterised by different kinds of diversity, such as in South Africa, the Balkans, India and Southeast Asia.

Wamkelekile kwiSebe leeLwimi zesiNtu / Welcome to the African Language Studies Department
In the African Language Studies Department we believe that our languages are not just means of communication but our identity and heritage.
It is language that underpins indigenous knowledge, knowledge formation, African identity and culture. As the Department, we seek to acknowledge and address the missing link in the Africanisation and transformation debate, which is the silent voice of language.
Through our department, UWC allows the study of African languages to become unsilenced and move towards the centre of the academic process. This process creates “mindfulness” and inclusivity as part of wider transformation of university culture that addresses the notion of previously silenced or marginalised voices (Langer 1989:69; Ting-Toomy 1999:3). This can be achieved through increasing the visibility of other languages used on campuses as well as the teaching and learning of African languages at UWC.
Our Department is home to all indigenous African languages, particularly isiXhosa and other Nguni languages as well as Sesotho at undergraduate level while at postgraduate level, particularly MA and PhD, all African languages are accommodated.
The department offers new market-related and job creation programmes such as Translation Studies and Forensic Linguistics 
Career opportunities:
Teaching (Mother-tongue and non-mother tongue)
Translation and Editing
Forensic linguistics
Journalism
Creative writing
The African Language Studies Department started in the 1980s as a Section under the Department of Anthropology under the leadership of Mr Frans Boot, with only three staff members: Prof Neethling, Mr AB Stuurman and Mrs A van Huysteen.
In later years, this section branched out to become a Department on its own and known as the Xhosa Department.
In 2020 the name was changed to the African Language Studies Department. The idea is to grow the Department and to offer postgraduate courses in all of the official languages. The undergraduate offerings will remain with a focus on isiXhosa, given the numbers of isiXhosa speakers in the Western Cape Province, though there will also be an emphasis on comparative isiNguni studies as well as other new fields of study such as Translation Studies and Forensic Linguistics.
The African Language Studies Department at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) offers a range of courses in isiXhosa. Some programmes focus on pure linguistics and others focus on applied language studies as well as on oral and written isiXhosa literature.
UWC is therefore an institution where the African Language Studies Department has a sustainable growth path through undergraduate and postgraduate studies against the backdrop of the institutional development plan as well as a process of transformation. New market-related and job creation programmes such as those offered in the Department including Forensic Linguistics and Translation Studies are ground-breaking and have the support of the university."

The Coding and Robotics Club
Coding and robotics are being introduced in the Foundation Phase CAPS curriculum in South African schools as from 2023. This should be welcomed, as research shows that coding and robotics teach and develop skills in learners such as analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, computational thinking and creativity.
Research in Foundation Phase has shown that coding holds affordances to develop scientific process skills in young learners. The problem is that we face a shortage of suitably qualified teachers to implement this curriculum imperative.
The Coding and Robotics Club envisages to provide the much-needed training and reskilling of teachers to facilitate coding and robotics in the Foundation Phase classroom, and to research the reformed teaching practices in the post-intervention classroom. The Club will also host activities for school learners and UWC students."

The Bilingual Learning Materials project (2022-2026), funded by the NRF, develops and trials science learning materials for primary schools in marginalized languages of the Western Cape. Led by Dr Robyn Tyler, the project explores how isiXhosa and Kaaps are used alongside English in bilingual materials and in classrooms. 'iSayensi Yethu' and 'Osse Science' are groundbreaking in their incorporation of these marginalized languages in high status texts in education. Language ideologies and translanguaging in a schooling context of coloniality are key theoretical concerns of the project."

Short learning programmes for teachers
STEM teachers can engage in various two- and three-day short learning programmes, or one-day workshops, to assist them in developing new knowledge and skills in various fields, such as: 
promoting inquiry learning in the STEM classroom
contextualising STEM curriculum themes through the infusion of indigenous knowledge
coding and robotics
developing entrepreneurial mind sets in learners.
Development and distribution of learning materials for under-resourced schools
With the assistance of our corporate funders, teaching and learning resources will be distributed in under-resourced schools.
For example, the SLCA has partnered with Prakash Labs at Stanford University, in distributing Foldscope microscopes in schools. These origami-type microscopes (costing 1 US$, or R18), provides a vehicle to enhance project-based learning in the science classroom.
Researching the impact of interventions, to ensure that donor funding does result in reformed teaching practices and positive change
Researchers visit schools, to identify factors that inhibit reformed teaching practices in the post-intervention classroom, in an attempt to further assist teachers in their professional development.

One of the areas of research in the Science Learning Centre for Africa (SLCA), is the affordances of indigenous knowledge in the science classroom.
The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescopes are erected in the Northern Cape, a region that is also the home to the oldest indigenous knowledge system in the world, namely the San. This juxtaposition of cutting-edge science and technology, and ancient indigenous knowledge, creates the context of some of the work of the SLCA.
The SLCA wants to create awareness of our rich indigenous heritage, and inspire a new generation of young scientists to pursue science careers in a complex 21st century.

Projects 
SSME staff are actively involved in a host of extramural activities that strengthen its visibility in the community, thereby enhancing its teaching and research profile.
Although the focus of SSME is the preparation of prospective science and mathematics teachers and fostering postgraduate research, its abiding interest in outreach activities of training, re-training and upgrading practising teachers, is continuously pursued through LEDIMTALI and the Science and IKS projects, as well as various projects organised by the Science Learning Centre for Africa.
The following are some of the community outreach projects that the SSME staff members have engaged in over the past five years: 
The IKS (Indigenous Knowledge System) project focuses on exploring the Nature of Science (NOS) and the Nature of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (NOIKS) in terms of their ontological, epistemological, axiological and metaphysical dimensions and how these collectively influence people’s (including learners’) cosmological world views.
Since its inception, the project has received a collaborative research grant from the National Research Foundation (NRF) in South Africa and the National Research Fund in Mozambique to carry out a systematic review of IKS research studies in the two countries between 1970 and 2012. 
The LEDIMTALI (Local Evidence-Driven Improvement of Mathematics Teaching and Learning Initiative) project led by Professor Cyril Julie has a research component.
The principal aim of the project is to bring together mathematics educators, mathematicians, mathematics teachers and mathematics curriculum advisors to work collectively and collaboratively to develop good teaching of mathematics.
The initiative is premised on the belief that such collective and collaborative work can lead to learners achieving at their highest potential in mathematics. 
The PrimTEd (Primary Teacher Education) project, led by Professor Rajendran Govender, is a component of the DHET’s Teaching and Learning Development Capacity Improvement Programme (TLDCIP), and as such is under the overall authority of the DHET’s Director-General.
The PrimTEd project is managed by the Chief Directorate for Teaching & Learning Development, located in the University branch of the TED."

BIOGRAPHY 
Ms Zainoenisa Allie’s professional career started as a full-time biological scientist and a part-time science educator. The path of her destiny as an inspirational science educator and researcher in science education started when these roles were swapped driven by her passion for teaching and learning. 
While doing biological sciences, Ms Allie’s role as an educator with exemplary teaching for understanding was indicative of the numerous awards she won for best poster and oral presentations at national and international conferences. This was further emphasised as her role as lecturer by her consistent positive student feedback showing the good relationship she had with students. In 2009 she quit her lecturing post and research in biological sciences to pursue a formal profession in science education. 
Ms Allie is currently a permanent lecturer (since 2015) and part-time doctoral student in science education at the School of Science and Mathematics Education. In 2017 she was awarded the Faculty of Education’s Emerging Lecturer's Award of Excellence in Teaching and Learning. 
This can be attributed to her innovative skills in the effective use of technology in education as well as her current research based lecture topics in her classrooms. She is particularly interested in the identification of alternative misconceptions (of science education students and teachers) on challenging science topics and instructional tools to address it. Furthermore, her research also includes the role that alternative conceptions play in the conceptual understanding of science topics.
Her compassion for community spans over nearly twenty years of involvement in educational outreach programmes for high school learners and teachers specifically in previously disadvantaged schools where she engages young minds through science. Her enthusiasm for science teaching and learning serve as an inspiration for future generations in the fields of science research and education as responsible human beings that will contribute not only to the acquisition of knowledge, but to the acquisition of knowledge as a responsible professional towards the upliftment of your community and country.
Ms Allie's research interests, in short, are: science education; alternative conceptions; conceptual understanding; technology in the science classroom.

Message from the Chairperson SON Student Council
We, members of the SON Student Council, understand that we are the link between students and the School of Nursing, and strive to build more than just a link but a relationship between both parties.
The SON Student Council was founded to be led by students, for students. As the SON Student Council, we are inspired and committed to being a transparent, active and effective council. We fully understand that a council should be led by students, for students; and that in a greater standing illuminate the concept that the University of the Western Cape Nursing Department is students and them being the crux of the department. 
Our vision is to support the School through implementing optimism, well-formed democracy, to build a united front as students and solidify the propitious vision of our department to develop leadership.

Why study nursing?
Nurses are highly skilled health care professionals who combine the art of caring with scientific knowledge and skills developed through their education and training. A nurse is responsible for the assessment, planning, provision and evaluation of nursing care as it relates to the promotion of health, the prevention of illness, care and rehabilitation of the sick. The aim is to improve the health outcomes for individuals, families and communities. 
The four year Bachelor of Nursing (B Nursing) qualification at UWC entitles you to practice as a general nurse and midwife after registration with the South African Nursing Council. Professional nurses who have qualified, provide a broad range of services in the clinical field, but may also follow careers in non-clinical areas. They work with a broad range of people across the lifespan (from infancy, adulthood to the elderly), and across a wide range of activities, from the care of the critically ill to the delivery of healthy infants. There are career opportunities for appropriately qualified nurses worldwide, with great demand both locally and internationally.
When you have completed the BNurs programme you will be able to work in hospitals, schools, communities, clinics, private practice, in industry, and in many other settings, including the military. You may also specialise in operating theatre technique, midwifery, intensive care, orthopaedic or paediatric nursing, and many other new fields such as forensic nursing, nurse practitioner and nurse advocate. There are also opportunities at the School of Nursing for further studies 
Programmes

The Bachelor of Nursing Programme
The B Nursing programme is a full-time, structured programme with prescribed modules offered over four years. In addition, registered students are placed in clinical facilities, such as hospitals, for compulsory clinical learning and are expected to fulfil the clinical requirements set out in the programme as directed by the South African Nursing Council according to R.174. 
To view information on the programme - see criteria for BNUR 8312 and BNUR 8313 to apply

Postgraduate
The current programme has a Postgraduate Diploma, Masters and PhD degrees in Child and Family Studies. Teaching and learning and supervision are interprofessional, interdisciplinary and collaborative concurrently ensuring that there is a sharing of expertise and a collective contribution to forming a critical mass in child, family and community research. Currently, 14 faculty members are involved with the supervision of the Masters and PhD students registered with the programme. These 14 faculty are from the following departments: Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Psychology, Social Work, Dietetics and Nutrition as well as Sports and Recreational Science. The Provincial DSD provided financial support to promote continuous education in CFS for Social Workers (46 participants over a period of 4 years completed the programme) and NGO staff (60 participants over a period of two years). For 2016, 30 students (9 DSD students and 21 UWC students) completed the Postgraduate Diploma Programme.
CISCFS started as a structured Masters programme in 2008 with approximately eight students. This programme evolved to offer a postgraduate diploma, Masters by full thesis and PhD in Child and Family Studies, which enabled a retention strategy for UWC and in the context of the Institutional Operational Plan (IOP), a strategy for “growing our own”. Currently, there are approximately 100 students registered across the three programmes with consistent outputs in each academic year, which aligns to developing UWC as a research-intensive university. The PhD programme has been operational since 2013 and produced its first graduate in 2016 followed by another five: one in 2017, two in 2018 and two in 2019; indicating potential for consistent throughput. This PhD programme provides the faculty and university, in relation to the IOP, an opportunity to maintain students in the system (Masters to PhD) - to “grow our own timber”, while the interdisciplinary nature of the programme allows for staff members of UWC to acquire a PhD where there may not be this opportunity in their field. Most importantly, the goal of CFS is to position UWC as a lead in family science in South Africa by developing change agents to promote and enable change through organisations such as the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC).
The Masters by full thesis had its first intake in 2012 and to date, over a 7-year period, approximately 50 students have graduated. The Postgraduate Diploma in Child and Family Studies was previously an exit strategy for the students who were unable to complete their structured master’s degree. With the inception of the full Masters thesis programme, however, a revision of the Postgraduate Diploma occurred with the introduction of a more comprehensive focus on theoretical approaches and exposure to research methodologies prior to entering the Masters programme."

After practising almost two years in the private health sector, she felt that a move to a different sector could help her make a greater contribution to the physiotherapy profession. In her current position, she is involved in the development and implementation of an interprofessional curriculum. She is actively involved in interprofessional collaborative practice supervision offered to senior undergraduate health science students, and she teaches and convenes interprofessional modules to entry-level health science students. The multi-faceted exposure at UWC helped her unveil a passion for developing innovative teaching and learning opportunities for student health professionals. She is currently enrolled as a doctoral student in physiotherapy with the goal of completion in August 2021. Her study aims to develop interprofessional guidelines for the incorporation into a proposed rehabilitation model in primary health care. The intended impact of her study is two-fold. Firstly, the development and enhancement of interprofessional core competencies serves as lifelong learning opportunities for health professionals in the field. Secondly, the successful implementation of an interprofessional model of health care creates a realistic platform for students to shift the theory of interprofessionalism into practice.

The Centre for Legal Integration in Africa in the Department of Private Law at the University of the Western Cape and the Department of Private Law at the University of Cape Town have convened jurists, scholars and practitioners to reflect on the impact of the Constitutional Court decision in Bhe and Others v Khayelitsha Magistrate and Others [15 October 2004]. This judgment, which invalidated the rule of primogeniture, is arguably the most significant judicial intrusion in African customary law since the end of apartheid. It has inspired law reforms and considerable scholarly commentary.
Twenty years after, we seek to examine its impact on the interaction of laws in South Africa. What is the pattern of the law reforms it has inspired? What should law reformers have done differently? Importantly, how have traditional communities embraced these reforms? Our five panels will explore these questions in a legal pluralist framework, using comparative, interdisciplinary and philosophical perspectives, as well as insights from the field.
We are proud to offer Keynotes by retired Constitutional Court judges, Albie Sachs and Dikgang Moseneke, as well as Janine Ubink, the President of the International Commission on Legal Pluralism and professor of law, governance and development at the Van Vollenhoven Institute in Leiden University, Netherlands.
We invite you to join our intellectual feast from 20 to 21 August using this online link. Please delve into our Book of Abstracts here and presenters’ bios here to learn more about our speakers.
If you have any questions, please contact us at dlgordon@uwc.ac.za (logistics), clia@uwc.ac.za and fatima.osman@uct.ac.za (thematic).

The Importance of this BCD 4-year Professional Degree to Society
The University of the Western Cape (UWC) will always be known “…as the ‘home of the democratic left, the epicentre of political struggle and contestation. It is also the institution where the interim 1993 South African Constitution was crafted against a commitment of enshrining the rights of all across its history of transformation, is the reality that this Institution remains nimble, resilient and open to change…” (DVC: Prof Lawack). This university has a rich history of engagement with the community, the environment and more broadly the world of knowledge. UWC is firmly committed to, and accountable for, its role in society as a knowledge production centre towards the advancement of mankind and her surroundings. It was therefore only fitting for UWC to launch its Bachelor of Community Development (BCD) in 2021; the first professional qualification of this kind to be delivered in the Western Cape and it was made possible through stakeholder partnerships and networks. The BCD will provide the next generation of Change Agents to ensure for improved well-being of communities and society at large. Please click here to watch a short video clip of our BCD programme. Contact us: Email: bcdinfo@uwc.ac.za Mobile: +27(72) 405 3952 Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/UWC-Community-Development
Community Development is an independent occupational profession and as such the BCD programme is Not a specialization field or programme for the Social Work occupation.
Community Development processes are intended to empower local communities and strengthen the capacity of people as active citizens through their communities, organizations and networks. They also seek to capacitate institutions and agencies to work in dialogue with citizens to shape and determine change in their communities. The community development processes involve members of a community in their own development and aim to enhance the capacity of the community to respond to its collective needs and resources.
The BCD emphasizes an integrated and holistic approach to community development. It is assumed that BCD graduates can work independently and that they operate at a high cognitive level and can solve complex, real-world problems and issues using evidence-based solutions and theory driven arguments.
This qualification requires the integration of theory and practice that will equip Student Community Development Practitioners (SCDPs) with the knowledge, skills and values needed to enhance the integration of all community development stakeholders for effective community development across all sectors involved in community development. It should ensure that Community Development Practitioners (CDPs) have a level of authority, responsibility and status within a regulated framework to facilitate processes that enable stakeholders and communities to participate in integrated planning processes and collective actions. The BCD is also registered as a professional degree and practitioners will be required to register via the Community Development Professional Board under the South African Council for Social Services Practitioners (SACSSP). (The rationale of this programme is as per the registered SAQA qualification ID 79706 – Bachelor of Community Development (2010).
Why should you study this BCD 4-year Professional Degree
The Bachelor of Community Development will meet the requirements for employment as a CDP in the Public Service, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Faith-Based Organisations (FBO), International Development Entities, Corporate and Civic Entities. It will produce CDP’s who are able to facilitate the collective action needed to build and empower communities including, but not limited to, the poor.
Graduates will be able to:
Facilitate community initiatives.
Integrate theory and practice to analyse needs and to plan and facilitate interventions in communities where they work in order to collectively build community capital to bring about social change and justice.
Promote change and community ownership that is self-sustaining.
Coordinate interactions with communities.
Conduct research in communities to facilitate and inform a participatory approach to development.
Promote the integrated well-being of a community according to the fundamental principles and ethics of community development.
(The purpose this programme is as per the registered SAQA qualification ID 79706 – Bachelor of Community Development (2010).

Please click here to download the programme brochure for ease of reference.
This program must ensure for eight (8) Exit Level Outcome (ELOs). Students will register for several modules in other faculties (EMS, Arts & Humanities and CHS). This is so that students are equipped during the studies with the skills and knowledge to not only work in multi-disciplinary teams but also intergrade and embrace the multi-disciplinary nature of Community Development.
The eight ELOs are presented below and all the module names are indicated in brackets at the end of each respective ELO. Additionally, students select between one of the following two specialization fields: 1) Community Sport and Recreation or 2) Community Health (Nutrition).
Community Sport and Recreation: 2nd to 4th Year (80 credits)
Please click here to download the flyer for this elective.
Community development is a way of bringing people together, identify problems and needs, discover resources, promote knowledge and skills, and strengthen leadership and contacts between communities. Sport and recreation are useful tools to foster community development, social inclusion and building positive social capital in communities. It allows for people from different backgrounds to interact with one another either as participants, volunteers or spectators. It is often regarded as community welfare rather than the responsibility of sport organisations. However, from a recreational perspective, can be seen as an ideal opportunity for recreation practitioners to ensure implementation of well-developed programs that are outcomes based to guarantee sustainability. This includes a thorough needs assessment, planning and implementation of programs, and application of management and evaluation practices bringing about social change in diverse communities. Additionally, sport and recreation programs benefit the community by enhancing personal choice and freedom, promote community life, provide access to social and physical spaces, it is multidimensional based on the needs and cultural relevance of the community, it is integral to social, cultural and economic development and most importantly promotes health through enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding activities.
Modules from 2nd to 4th year:
Principles of Sport Management (SRE211); Sport in Society (SRE221); Theory: Recreation (SRE237); Contemporary Sport & Recreation Management (SRE315); Sport & Community Development (SRE317); Management Major (SRE322); Recreation & Leisure Studies (SRE415); Recreation & Leisure Studies (SRE425).
Community Health (Nutrition): 2nd to 4th year (80 Credits)
Please click here to download the flyer for this elective.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health as a state of “complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Nutritional well-being is pivotal in the achievement of complete physical, mental and social well-being for individuals and therefor for communities and populations. Investing in the nutritional status and the food security of a community , from infancy through to adulthood, including during pregnancy, will improve quality of life, increase productivity and this will have a positive impact on health status and the economic returns that comes with it. Global issues of development are becoming increasingly complex. Sustainable and holistic development, which includes nutrition, offers a framework to balance the required development dimensions of economic, ecological and sociocultural at global and local levels. Community development practitioners, with a specialisation in nutrition, will be able to address malnutrition through involvement and contribution to nutrition intervention programmes in communities and also to nutrition policies. In this way, they will use their specialized knowledge to the advantage of the nutrition well-being of all age groups in a community. This will contribute to achieve the overall aim of a better life for all.
Modules from 2nd to 4th Year
Introduction to Health and Nutrition within a Community Development Context (NUT214); Community nutrition programming in a community development context(NUT322); Macro- and Micronutrients and Nutrition through the Life Cycle Stages (NUT224); Applied Community Nutrition (NUT402)."

What is ‘cutting edge’ or distinctive about your (your unit’s) research and the postgraduate programmes you offer?
Our unit, jointly owned by UWC and the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), provides state-of-the-art Proteomics research and services, mostly to Agricultural and Biotechnology researchers and private companies in South Africa. This work is mostly funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) through the National Equipment Programme (NEP) of the National Research Foundation (NRF).
Proteomics is a collection of relatively new tools and expertise for Biologists and (Bio) chemists and its practical applications are growing fast (see below). Proteomics is the term that describes a multitude of tools and expertise used primarily to profile and identify proteins of interest in any organisation at a large scale. Proteins are the functional/operational units in cells, and ‘proteins of interests’ often include biomarkers for certain diseases or physiological/developmental status. We have post graduate students ranging from BSc interns, Honours, Master's, PhD and Post-­docs applying proteomics in their own various biological experiments.
For example, one could use proteomics to investigate effects of pathogens on cells/tissues/organs/organism, protein expression levels and patterns. This information could be used to identify targets/strategies for the improvement of pathogen resistance by both plants and animals. 
How is your (your unit’s) research linked to societal benefit?
Each year we train dozens of postgraduate students.
We are lucky in that we are able to attract and retain talented and hardworking students, and most of them are from disadvantaged backgrounds, creating a stable foundation for the next generation of scientists and biotech-­entrepreneurs.
We provide services (advice/consultation, sample analysis and workshops) to students and researchers from internal and external research groups.
One of our applications include a brand new MALDI Biotyper App. that enables us to identify microorganisms in a Super-­fast speed. Our MALDI Biotyper App enables us to identify microorganisms (like bacteria) within 1-­5 minutes and this is achieved relatively cheaply. This has many applications in food safety and diagnostics related areas of science.
We are also interested in Biofuels research using the most important grain in Africa, called (Sweet) Sorghum. This research project has already created more than 15 jobs in the Eastern Cape. Our projection is that we’ll be employing an average of 70-­100 rural people per annum within the next 3-­5 years – while producing environmentally friendly fuels and biomaterials such as bioethanol, natural rubber and biomass.
What has been a significant achievement/breakthrough in your (your unit’s) research recently that potential postgraduate students would want to know about?
Production of MSc and PhD students whose thesis are based on exciting Africa-­centric problems.
Above average publications in internationally peerreviewed journals.
One of our post docs (Dr Ngara) was a finalist in an Africa-wide Women In-Science competition. Through this, she received generous funding to attend various workshop/trainings in various African countries including Uganda and Ghana.
Success of the DST/NRF National Equipment Programme grant and acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment worth close to R10 million.
The group is relatively young and tries to keep science fun and accessible.
Is there any other information about your (your unit’s) research and postgraduate programmes that you feel is important to showcase?
Our vision is to continue to play a meaningful role in South Africa’s mission of creating a transformed, vibrant and competitive scientific community. This in combination with our national/continental wealth in biodiversity, natural resources and indigenous knowledge of systems, will place us in a strategic position as one of the World leaders in Knowledge Based Bioeconomy (KBBE) by 2030 (in line with our current Nat. Dev. Programme).

Honours, MA and PhD programmes are open to speakers of all African languages (including isiXhosa) and this is seen as a growth node for the Department and for the University. The Department is promoting the use of indigenous languages at UWC. This need to promote multilingualism is in line with Section 6 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which recognizes eleven official languages, including nine indigenous African Languages. It is also in line with the requirements of the Ministry of Higher Education’s call for multilingualism to be further entrenched at South African institutions of higher learning. There is a call not only to promote and improve the status of African Languages, but also to make use of them as media of instruction. 
The following modules are offered for the Honours programme and students are to select three modules with Research Essay as the fourth and compulsory module:
Syntax
Phonology
Morphology
Translation studies
Sociolinguistics
Onomastics
Media and Performance Arts Studies
Modern Prose
Modern Poetry
Research Essay (Compulsory)
Method of Second Language Acquisition
Forensic Linguistics"

The Language Education Department is a fast-growing department that is integral to the faculty’s teaching, research and community engagement endeavours. Regarding teaching, the department offers some 50 courses across four undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, aimed at producing language teachers who are competent in English, Afrikaans and/or isiXhosa, and who are at home in multilingual classes.
Research foci include early literacy with particular reference to the foundation phase, mother tongue and multilingual schooling, educational linguistics, literature and education, ICT’s in language education, youth literacy and poverty, and language policy in education.
What makes the department special, is the forging of a critical language/literacy-as-resource orientation within a decolonising frame."
